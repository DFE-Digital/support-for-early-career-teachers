Video transcript.

Our memory can be a fickle thing. 


  You might be able to remember the name of the first street you lived on, but
  you cannot remember where you left your keys last night or the name of that
  colleague who introduced themselves to you on the first day of term. 



  While it can feel frustrating that our memory sometimes appears only to
  remember useless information, as opposed to the information we really do need
  (

<i>
  where are those keys?),
</i>

  
  in fact we now know a lot about how the memory works and, importantly for you
  as a teacher, how it affects learning.


Cognitive science 
‒
 that is the science of learning 
‒


has come a long way in the past 30 years. Research into the functioning of the
mind and the brain have greatly enhanced our understanding of learning,
memory, intelligence and emotion, all of which have fundamental implications
for education.



  By understanding how the brain works, we can design more effective learning
  for our pupils in terms of instruction, materials, environments and
  experiences.



  Psychologists and neuroscientists have known that there are different parts of
  our memory which perform different roles since the 1960s. Very simply we have
  a long-term memory which is where everything we know is stored. Examples of
  this include facts such as your home address or the formula for the area of a
  triangle. Information in the long-term memory is organised into groups or
  “schema”. These schemata are ever-expanding networks of knowledge which make
  up “what you know”. 



  When we encounter a new idea or experience it enters our working memory, which
  is a short-term store for information while we are processing it. To help us
  make sense of the new material, we pull relevant information from our
  long-term memory to see if we can connect this new idea into an existing
  schema. If possible, we connect the new content to our existing knowledge;
  this makes it both easier to remember the new idea

<i>
  and 
</i>
strengthens the prior knowledge we had. 


  So why do some items of information end up in the long-term memory and others
  not?


Well, there are a few reasons:

- It might be that you didn't have any secure prior knowledge to connect the new learning to and so the new information has nothing to tether it to a schema in your long-term memory.
- It could be that you weren't paying attention or actively engaging with the new material ‒ such as that colleague's name when they introduced themselves.
- Another reason might be that there were too many bits of new information in your working memory for you to deal with. We call this “cognitive overload”.
  
  All of this is really important to remember when you are introducing new
  content to pupils. Pupils are constantly encountering new material. It might
  seem surprising to you, but pupils' working memory can easily become
  overloaded and when that happens, no learning will take place. The same
  applies if pupils do not pay enough attention to the thing being taught, or if
  their prior knowledge is either insufficient or
  
  <i>
  not
  </i> <i>
  activated
  </i>
   before encountering the new content.


  Luckily, what cognitive science has taught is that there are some
  well-evidenced techniques which you can use to prevent pupils' working memory
  becoming overloaded such as:

- Introducing new content in small, manageable steps. 
- Breaking complex material into smaller steps. 
- Making explicit links to prior knowledge so that pupils can more easily connect it to existing schema. 
- Reducing distractions as much as possible, such as superfluous explanations or visuals. 
- Sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before encountering more complex content. 
- Providing opportunities for pupils to use new content again, spaced across the year.

  If you haven't come across this before it might feel a bit overwhelming to
  have to think about cognitive science and how the brain works at this stage in
  your career, but don't worry. This Block has been designed to introduce you to
  the most important aspects of how pupils learn and to provide practical and
  easy to understand examples to translate into your classroom practice. This is
  perhaps the most important professional knowledge you need as a teacher

–

  
  if you don't understand how pupils learn, or what prevents learning, then you
  cannot plan and teach effective lessons. Because of this, you will see that
  many of the ideas and concepts which you will begin to explore in this Block
  are repeated and expanded upon as you progress through the next two years. 



  You will have plenty of opportunities to work with your mentor to apply the
  learning from this Block into your lessons. And don't forget, you can always
  ask your mentor what that colleague's name is!
