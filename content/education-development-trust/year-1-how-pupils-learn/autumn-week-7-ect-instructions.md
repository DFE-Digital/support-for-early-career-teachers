- Use this time to plan and carry out some observations of yourself or colleagues.
- Observations need only to be for a small part of a lesson and should be focused upon specific aspects of classroom practice.
- Record notes of the key things you observed.
- Record what you plan to do yourself in your practice as a result.
- You could use video to carry out your observations. Videoing your lessons gives you the opportunity to review what is happening in your classroom and see for yourself which strategies are most effective. You can share the video with your mentor.
