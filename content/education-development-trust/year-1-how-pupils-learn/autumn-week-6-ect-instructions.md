- There are three areas for you to develop your classroom practice.
- Click on each one to go to a summary of why it’s important, what success looks like and ideas for practice.
- Select one of the ideas for practice from each area to try out in your classroom.
- This will require some additional planning either individually or in collaboration with a colleague.
- You should also evaluate the effectiveness of the approach you use and impact of this in discussion with your mentor.

## The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

### Learn that:

- Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas
- Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new task, process or problem are also likely to support pupils to learn

### Learn how to build on pupils’ prior knowledge, by:

- Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so that misconceptions can be addressed
