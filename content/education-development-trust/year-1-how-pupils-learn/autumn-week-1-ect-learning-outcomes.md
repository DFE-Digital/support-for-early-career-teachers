### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

#### Learn that:

- Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding. - An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory.
- Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded.
- Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.
- In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.

### In your notepad

Keep a note of your responses to the following questions and bring them with you
to your first mentor session for this module to inform your discussions:

- what do you understand as the difference between long-term memory and
  working memory?

- what happens when the working memory becomes overloaded?

- how might this affect learning in the classroom?

- what are some of the techniques which you read about which a teacher can use
  to ensure that pupils don’t become overloaded?
