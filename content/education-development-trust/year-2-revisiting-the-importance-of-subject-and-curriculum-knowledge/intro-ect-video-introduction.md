  As you established in Block 4, subject knowledge is of critical importance. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This Block will focus on key aspects of your practice to support you in
  curriculum design and delivery. In particular, we will focus on how you can
  use your improved understanding of how the subject or subjects you teach
  ‘work’ to deepen and strengthen your pupils’ subject knowledge. You will build
  on your learning from Block 2 and Block 4 around how knowledge is constructed
  and developed and the different strategies you can use to support your pupils
  to become more successful learners.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Knowledge is built by linking new ideas to existing knowledge. We know that
  pupils are likely to forget what they have learnt without specific strategies
  to support them in transferring knowledge to their long-term memory, as
  covered in Block 2 and 8. We will look at tasks that support pupils to learn
  key ideas securely, and that build automatic recall of key knowledge through
  retrieval and spaced practice. In this way you can help pupils apply knowledge
  and skills to other contexts, and to think critically, by drawing attention to
  the underlying structure of problems and how concrete examples can lead to
  abstract ones. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In the self-directed study materials, we will look specifically at how to help
  pupils build more complex mental models. You can support your pupils to do
  this by drawing explicit links between new content and the core concepts and
  principles in the subjects you teach. This will allow pupils to pin new
  knowledge to the foundations of the subject you are teaching; creating a
  logical system in which ideas, knowledge and skills are linked rather than
  stand-alone ‘facts’, easily forgotten. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  As you established in Block 4, developing excellent subject and curriculum
  knowledge is a process that takes time. You will probably feel more confident
  now than you did at this point last year. However, continuing to work with
  more experienced colleagues who can offer you support, advice and practical
  strategies is an important part of your development as a teacher. This Block
  encourages you to do this in relation to longer-term planning.
