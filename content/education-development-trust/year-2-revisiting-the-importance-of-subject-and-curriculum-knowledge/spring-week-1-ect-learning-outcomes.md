The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to learn how to support pupils to build increasingly complex mental models by:

- Discussing curriculum design with experienced colleagues and balancing exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge.
- Revisiting the big ideas of the subject over time and teaching key concepts through a range of examples.                                  
- Drawing explicit links between new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject.
