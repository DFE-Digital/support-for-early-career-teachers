## Training session - retrieval practice techniques

Duration: 75 minutes

### Session objectives

### Learn that:

- 2.2. Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.
- 2.5. Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.
- 2.7. Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.
- 2.8. Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall.

### Learn how to:

Increase likelihood of material being retained, by:

- 2i. Planning regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time.
- 2j. Designing practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting challenging work.

### How to prepare for the session

Read the ECT’s self-study materials for this topic.

Ask ECTs to revisit the following modules from Year 1:

- [understanding how pupils learn](https://support-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/education-development-trust/year-1-how-pupils-learn/)
- [developing effective classroom practice](https://support-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/education-development-trust/year-1-developing-effective-classroom-practice/)

### Session structure:

### Introduction to the session (5 minutes)

Explain that this session will support ECTs to:

- develop an understanding of how retrieval practice can be used to consolidate and develop knowledge, both within lessons and over time
- recap on the roles of memory and schemas in learning, and how retrieval practice can support both
- be able to identify a range of approaches that can be used within lessons

### Activating prior knowledge (15 mins)

Ask ECTs to complete the following from memory:

A) According to Willingham’s ‘Simple Memory Model’, what are the three components of memory?

Answers: Environment, working memory, long-term memory.

B) What’s the difference between long-term and working memory?

Answer: Long-term memory is the vast store for all of your knowledge and facts about the world. It has no known capacity. Working memory is where you actively process new information. It has a limited capacity and can become overloaded.

c) Name 3 ways a teacher can reduce the cognitive load to help pupils learn.  

Answers could include:

- taking pupils’ prior knowledge into account when introducing new content
- directly linking new learning to prior knowledge
- introducing new or complex material in smaller, accessible steps
- using aids to reduce the burden on cognitive load, such as writing steps on the whiteboard
- using partially completed examples
- minimising distractions, such as complexity of tasks, to keep the focus on the content
- sequencing lessons so pupils secure foundational knowledge first before encountering more complex content
- helping pupils to commit some key facts to their long-term memory to free up working memory space

Share this quote:

"Long term memory is now viewed as the central, dominant structure of human cognition. Everything we see, hear, and think about is dependent on and influenced by our long term memory."

Clark, Kirschner and Sweller, 2012

Remind ECTs that:

- a schema is an interconnected web of items and knowledge
- our long-term memory contains many schemas
- learning is the development of an increasingly robust and detailed schema
- retrieval practice supports the development of the complexity of ideas, so develops schemas
- as experts we have robust and detailed schemas that make us able to spot patterns that pupils (novices) do not
- novices need to transfer new knowledge to their long-term memory: this is learning

### Supporting pupils to transfer knowledge to long-term memory through practice (5 mins)

Retrieval practice is one way that we can support pupils to transfer knowledge to long-term memory.

Share the following:

- retrieval means bringing information to mind: we’re retrieving information from our long-term memory into our working memory
- retrieval practice is about engaging pupils in activities (for example asking them questions) with the intention of purposefully retrieving information from long-term memory
- it helps us connect new knowledge to old, so it develops our schema
- Rosenshine refers to it as a daily, weekly and monthly review
- we often talk about ‘getting information into students’ heads’, but it’s better if we think about how we get it out
- retrieval is not re-teaching a topic or recapping: effective retrieval practice is done with the memory in mind

### Using retrieval practice as part of your practice (30 mins)

Reflect that ECTs are probably already using retrieval practice of some kind, such as:

- asking questions
- using quizzes
- providing homework and independent ‘practice’ activities

Any activity that requires pupils to bring information to mind is a retrieval activity.

Ask ECTs to discuss how much this resonates with their own practice.

Do they currently use retrieval, or see how it could be used?

Share and discuss these tips for executing retrieval practice:

- whenever possible it should be done from memory (closed book)
- involve everyone
- make checking accurate and easy
- it should be possible for all students to find out what they got right and wrong, what they know well and where they have gaps
- every technique involves students testing their knowledge and then checking their work for accuracy and completeness
- specify the knowledge, and where appropriate do this in advance so pupils can study, prepare and self-check
- keep it generative: students need to explore their memory to check what they know and understand
- remove cue cards, prompts and scaffolds: they need to be thinking for themselves
- make it time-efficient: each technique should be quick and can be used repeatedly
- make it workload efficient: none of these methods involve the teacher checking the students’ answers, creating unsustainable workload

Based on Sherrington, 2019.

Ask ECTs to work in groups to discuss which of the following activities they think are most useful:

a) Frequent quick-fire quizzes

- the teacher reads out or presents the question
- questions can be spontaneously generated or prepared
- questions can be simple factual recall, mental maths or multiple choice
- all students write down and check their own answers, with the teacher revealing the answers one by one or all at once
- it's important that the teacher discusses common wrong answers, this is one of the main functions

b) Gimme 5

Ask pupils to list 5 things they remember about a topic.

c) Who? What? Where? When? Why?

Ask 5 questions that connect with prior learning or new learning. Each new question should begin with one of the 5 ‘Ws’. For example:

- who said?
- what does?
- where was?
- when did?
- why did?

d) 3, 2, 1

- List 3 facts about...
- List 2 features of...
- List 1 example of...

e) 10 for 10

Options include:

- Order 10 events in chronological order…
- List 10 features of…
- Rank 10 pivotal moments in…
- List 10 processes of…
- List 10 things about…
- List 10 things you remember about…
- Rank 10 things about… in order of…

f) Brain dump

Give pupils 5 minutes to write down something from memory. For example:

- from memory, write down the process of how we convert a fraction to a percentage
- write down everything you know about World War 2

f) Knowledge organiser quiz

- use as a quiz by testing students on certain sections
- knowledge organisers have their limitations as they’re just lists of facts, which do not show how those pieces of information are interconnected
- always link the knowledge and make patterns explicit

g) Multiple choice questions

- prominent researchers have found that these are particularly effective at realising the benefits of ‘the testing effect’ (Bjork, Little and Storm 2014)
- all answer should be plausible so that pupils do not rely on simply picking the familiar answer 

h) Quizzing with concept maps

- help facilitate successful retrieval through scaffolding, which is particularly helpful for SEN and younger students
- use concept maps to manage cognitive load
- try using the map first, allowing students to fill it out with notes in front of them before taking the notes away
- finally, ‘go cold’ with a blank concept map

You can read ‘Understanding How We Learn’ by Weinstein and Sumeracki (2019) for more information.

i) Using graphic organisers

- these are more strategic as they force students to organise knowledge
- they can be done partially completed to scaffold, or blank
- scaffolds support younger or SEN students

Ask ECTs to share their thoughts on:

- which activities they feel would be most useful
- how some activities may be better suited to specific subjects, phases or contexts
- how they might train their pupils to complete these activities

### Adapting one resource for my pupils (10 minutes)

Ask ECTs to work in pairs or small groups. 
They should select one of the activities above and adapt it for a particular topic or concept that they’ve taught or will be teaching.

### Planning for action (10 minutes)

Ask ECTs:

- what will you now do differently in your practice?
- what will you put into action in your lessons?
