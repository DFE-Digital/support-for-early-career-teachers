## The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

| Learn that                                                                                                                                                    |

| 2.1 Learning involves a lasting change in pupilsâ€™ capabilities or understanding.                                                                              |
| 2.3 An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory.                       |
| 2.7 Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.             |
| 2.8 Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall. |



### In your notepad

#### Key questions

* why is it important that pupils remember what they have learned?
* what is practice testing and what impact does it have?
* why is feedback during practice important?
* what makes retrieval practice so effective in helping pupils to remember
      over time?
