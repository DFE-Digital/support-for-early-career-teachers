Video transcript.



<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It’s one thing for pupils to recall the content they have just encountered
  during a lesson, and quite another for them to be able to recall and use it
  weeks or even months later.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This is important in all sorts of ways. As we have seen, knowledge and
  expertise accumulate, with new information linking to and reinforcing what we
  knew already. Poor recall may well indicate that this is not happening. While
  as an adult you may not remember everything that you were taught in school,
  much of it will be helping to support the knowledge you currently have and
  use. And not unimportantly for schools, pupils’ knowledge is tested at various
  points in their education to see what they have learned. If everything goes in
  one ear and out the other, neither the pupil nor the school will get the
  formal recognition of their successes, and all that this brings.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In Block 2, you explored how pupils learn; how the working memory can become
  overloaded and how we as teachers can use our understanding of how children
  learn to design instruction and tasks which support pupils when learning new
  material. Hopefully, you have been using many of the techniques over the past
  year, such as introducing new material in small steps and providing worked
  examples, and have seen the benefit of these in helping pupils to learn
  better. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This Block builds directly on Block 2. We are now considering how we can make
  new learning ‘stick’ over time so that pupils remember what they have been
  taught. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This is relevant at all phases and in all subjects.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In Early Years, you need pupils to be able to remember certain things, such as
  which hook to put their coats on to avoid chaos at pick-up time! They will
  also be developing some of the fundamental knowledge and know-how that they
  need for success at school and throughout their lives.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In Primary and Secondary, as you plan to teach more complex ideas or concepts
  you will be building on previously taught material. Again, all new learning is
  based on prior knowledge. Pupils connect new ideas into existing schemata in
  their long-term memory. The better pupils remember something, the more easily
  they will be able to grasp new ideas. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The point about not remembering everything we encounter at school is of course
  important: there is always going to be an element of decay in our memories.
  This comes down to two main factors; storage strength
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  how well did you embed the learning in your long-term memory? And retrieval
  strength
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  how often you have accessed the memory over time? At some point, knowledge
  will fade if it is not useful to you or used by you.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Although there is a level of responsibility which lies with your pupils
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  
  Did they spend any time revising in advance of the test? Did they actively
  think about which hook to put their coat onto?
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  as the teacher you also have responsibility to plan how you will support
  pupils to retain information over time. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Education researchers have identified some effective ways teachers can help
  pupils to do this. For example:
</span>
- Making sure pupils encounter new material more than once and at spaced intervals 
- Incorporating tasks which require pupils to actively retrieve information from their memory 
- Providing opportunity to practise new material, ideally with feedback.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The added benefit of planning activities like these into your lessons
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and making the reason clear to pupils </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  is that it demonstrates which study approaches work best. As pupils get older,
  and do more independent study, they will be using techniques which are shown
  to be effective as opposed to less effective techniques such as highlighting
  text or passively re-reading pages of notes. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Remember, it is not just about the exam at the end of the year. You are
  setting pupils up for a lifetime of learning. In Early Years and Primary you
  are teaching pupils the foundational skills which they need to access all
  subjects and disciplines such as reading and writing. At Secondary level,
  perhaps pupils will choose to continue studying your subject at Key Stage
  Four, college or university and the knowledge you help them to retain now will
  form the basis of even more rewarding learning to come.
