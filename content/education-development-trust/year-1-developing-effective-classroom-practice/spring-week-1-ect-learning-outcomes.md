### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

#### Learn that:

- Effective teaching can transform pupilsâ€™ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning.
- Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned.
- Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible.
- Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases.
- Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success.

### In your notepad

As you work this through activity try to answer the following questions:

- why is introducing new material in steps so important?
- why should you explicitly link new ideas to what has been previously studied
  and learned?
- what are three characteristics of effective modelling?
- why should you consider when and how you will remove support and/or
  scaffolding?
- why is pupil practice important?
