## Observation focus: Introducing material in small steps

### Possible focus during the observation:

- How were complex ideas broken down into parts?
- How did each activity build on the previous one?
- Did pupils grasp the ideas? How do you know?

## Observation focus: Use of modelling

### Possible focus during the observation:

- Did the teacher use modelling?
- What kind of modelling was used?
- Did it aid pupils' understanding?
- How do you know?

## Observation focus: Understanding pupil differences

### Possible focus during the observation:

- Discuss with a colleague how they go about understanding pupil differences and potential barriers to learning in their class(es)

For each observation, write down:

- who you observed
- what happened
- what you have learned from these lesson observations
- what ideas you will carry on using or try out in your practice
