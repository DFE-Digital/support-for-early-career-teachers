- You should use this time to plan and carry out observations of colleagues or be observed yourself. Use the form below to record the key things you observed or learned.
- Record what you plan to do yourself in your practice as a result.
- In Mentor Session 1.6, you will have a chance to reflect on what you learn from observing other colleagues or being observed yourself.
- You might choose to observe or be observed on one of the foci below or on a range of the foci.
- Use the suggested observation ideas to plan your observations. You don’t need to do all of them but choose the one(s) that you feel will be most helpful – your mentor can help you plan this.
- You could use video to carry out your observations. Videoing your lessons gives you the opportunity to review what is happening in your classroom and see for yourself which strategies are most effective. You can share the video with your mentor.
