### Learn that:
- Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.
- Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.
- Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.
- Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture.
-A culture of mutual trust and respect supports effective relationships.
- Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood.

### Learn how to develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:
- Responding quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.

In the first section of this activity, we looked at using rules and routines to support an effective climate for learning. In part b we take a closer look at how our relationships with pupils and our expectations of them can have a direct impact on behaviour and the learning environment in our classroom.
