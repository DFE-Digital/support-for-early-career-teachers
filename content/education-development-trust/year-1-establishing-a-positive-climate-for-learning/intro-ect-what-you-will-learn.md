### Instructions

- Look over the statements covered in this Block.
- Watch the video, which introduces what you will learn in this Block and why it is important.
- Take your reflections, and any questions you have, to discuss in your first mentor session.

### In this Block, you will learn the following:

**Learn that:**

- Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.
- Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.
- Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.
- Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture.
- A culture of mutual trust and respect supports effective relationships.
- Establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment.
- A predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs.
- Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood.               

**Learn how to demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations, by:**    

- Seeking opportunities to engage parents and carers in the education of their children (e.g. proactively highlighting successes).
- Creating a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed (e.g. by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils).
- Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations (e.g. for contributions, volume level and concentration).
- Applying rules, sanctions and rewards in line with school policy, escalating behaviour incidents as appropriate.
- Acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made.                                                                                                         

**Learn how to develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:**
                                                                                           
- Establishing a supportive and inclusive environment with a predictable system of reward and sanction in the classroom.
- Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions.
- Checking pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins.
- Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.
- Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption.
- Responding quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.                                                                                                     

**Learn how to establish effective routines and expectations, by:**

- Creating and explicitly teaching routines in line with the school ethos that maximise time for learning (e.g. setting and reinforcing expectations about key transition points). 
- Practising routines at the beginning of the school year.
- Reinforcing routines (e.g. by articulating the link between time on task and success).   
                                                                                            
**Learn how to build trusting relationships, by:**

- Liaising with parents, carers and colleagues to better understand pupils’ individual circumstances and how they can be supported to meet high academic and behavioural expectations.
- Responding consistently to pupil behaviour.
