  Welcome to Block 1. Block 1 is about creating an effective climate for
  learning for your pupils.



  It is natural for behaviour management to preoccupy new teachers. Poor
  behaviour makes it hard for pupils to learn. As a teacher, the feeling of not
  being in charge of the lesson can be really demoralising. You will inevitably
  contrast what you do with more experienced colleagues, but it can be hard to
  identify the strategies they use to develop a positive climate for learning.
  It can be easy to assume that you either have 'it' or you don't. 



  The good news is that this doesn't need to be the case! A positive learning
  environment is carefully crafted through specific teacher planning and
  actions, and everyone can do this. In short, you need to teach your pupils how
  to behave in your classroom, setting clear expectations and reinforcing these
  with consistent routines. Over time, this will help pupils understand how to
  take responsibility for their behaviour, through self-regulation, monitoring
  their own actions, and making the right choices. In this type of environment,
  pupils will feel more supported and secure, and you will be happier in your
  job.



  When you know what to look for, you will see two different aspects of
  behaviour management. One is the multi-faceted skill of dealing effectively
  with instances of misbehaviour. This is a skill which improves with
  experience, but it's also something that is dependent on knowing your pupils
  well as individuals. The second, more desirable, aspect is the proactive
  orchestration of classroom conditions in which poor behaviour is less likely
  to happen. 



  To help with this, your goal should be to develop positive relationships and a
  culture of respect and trust with your pupils. Get to know your pupils, learn
  their names, talk to them about how they are learning and tell them what you
  expect of them. Give them the chance to learn how to behave well, and model
  this yourself. Your school will have policies and practices to support you and
  these should be followed from the outset. However, systems and policies alone
  cannot create a positive learning environment. Your actions,

<i>
  your
</i>

  
  behaviour and how you respond to your pupils are key. 


The 

teachers we remember the most are those who were fair and consistent in how
they treated us. They are also the ones we knew had high expectations of both
our behaviour and what we could achieve. They inspired us to do more, do
better and produce our best. 



  You are responsible for creating and managing the climate within your
  classroom. Your actions can influence the way your pupils behave, the way that
  they feel about your lessons and the results they achieve. This Block has been
  designed to support you in securing the kind of positive climate for learning
  which will have a direct impact on your teaching and your pupils' learning. It
  will help you do all of the things we have just described: develop and
  reinforce rules and routines, support you in establishing positive
  relationships with pupils and show you ways to set and maintain high
  expectations.



  Creating a culture in which pupils want to work hard and actively resist
  temptations to misbehave will benefit both your workload and wellbeing but
  also your pupils' attitudes, wellbeing and motivation. It is not something
  that can be established instantly but instead something that is consciously
  crafted over time. However, if you consistently teach and model your rules,
  routines and expectations and embed these securely, a positive climate for
  learning will follow before too long.
