- There are four areas for you to develop your classroom practice. Click on each one to go to a summary of why it is important, what success looks like and ideas for practice.
- Select one of the ideas for practice from each area to try out in your classroom (note that for some areas there is only one idea to try out).
- This will require some additional planning either individually or in collaboration with a colleague.
- You should also evaluate the effectiveness and impact of this in discussion with your mentor.

## Learn how to develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:

- Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions.
- Checking pupilsâ€™ understanding of instructions before a task begins.
- Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.
- Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption.
