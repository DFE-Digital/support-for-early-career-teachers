### In this topic, you will learn the following

#### Learn that:
- Establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment.

#### Learn how to establish effective routines and expectations, by:
- Creating and explicitly teaching routines in line with the school ethos that maximise time for learning (e.g. setting and reinforcing expectations about key transition points). 
- Practising routines at the beginning of the school year.
- Reinforcing routines (e.g. by articulating the link between time on task and success).
