## Training session - early and least intrusive interventions

Duration: 90 minutes

### Session objectives

Demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations, by:

- 1e Creating a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed (for example, by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils)
- 1g Applying rules, sanctions and rewards in line with school policy, escalating behaviour incidents as appropriate 

Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:

- 7f Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption

Build trusting relationships, by:

- 7l Responding consistently to pupil behaviour

### How to prepare for the session

The ECT doesn’t have a self-study element this week. Instead, you should use the materials below to help you plan a session with them about this topic.

### Session structure

Least-intrusive interventions (15 minutes)

1. Welcome participants. Explain that they’re going to focus on the following 4 ECF statements:

Demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations, by:

- 1e Creating a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed (for example, by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils)
- 1g Applying rules, sanctions and rewards in line with school policy, escalating behaviour incidents as appropriate

Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:

- 7f Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption.

Build trusting relationships, by:

- 7l Responding consistently to pupil behaviour  

2. Think-pair-share activity: Ask ECTs to think about their class, or a class they teach.

Ask: What would you change about the behaviour of that class?

Allow:

- 30 seconds for ECTs to think
- ECTs to share with a partner or group

3.	Take feedback, drawing in whether ideas are similar or different.

4. Run through the following points:

- it’s likely that you’re experiencing similar issues with behaviour (such as low-level disruption) as many other teachers, including those who are very experienced
- managing behaviour is an ongoing challenge for all teachers
- even the most experienced teachers have to work at managing behaviour
- developing a good climate for learning can help support behaviour

5. Explain that today’s session will look at least-invasive techniques that can be used to correct behaviour.

You’ll also examine the link between using the techniques and building positive relationships with pupils.

### Intervention techniques (30 minutes)

1. Reflect that ECTs might feel that when a lot of pupils are on task, and only a small number are off task or distracted, that it’s better to let them carry on rather than waste time by stopping the group to address the issue.

2. Explain that the purpose of this exercise is to understand the benefit of ensuring they have 100% focus in class.

It’s fine to stop the class to get all pupils back on track, but it's even better to use our 	least-invasive techniques to correct behaviour with minimal disruption.

3. Read this scenario aloud, or share it for ECTs to read alone and then discuss in pairs.

> You have given your class a task to complete, and you have asked them to complete it in silence. Some pupils have got started and are working well, a few are half working but chatting quietly, and a small number are totally off task.

Ask ECTs what they would do.

4. Explain that:

- you always want 100 per cent attention and focus from your class
- it's important that you settle for nothing less
- stopping a class for a reset can be effective if used judiciously, but avoid constantly stopping and resetting
- intervention should be fast and invisible – this is what you’re focusing on today

5. Share and discuss the 3 least-invasive techniques.

- non-verbal signals, such as raising your hand or putting your fingers to your lips when you want silence
- positive group reminder: telling the class what they should be doing at that moment as a prompt to pupils who need it, such as "I need all eyes on the board"
- anonymous reminder: telling the class what they should be doing and noting that there are some pupils who are not complying, for example "I need all eyes on the board. I need 2 more sets of eyes"

6. Ask ECTs to work in pairs or groups to discuss or write down the reasons for using each technique. 

These could include:

#### Non-verbal signals

- fast and invisible correction
- addresses behaviour instantly
- does not disrupt the flow of learning
- does not disrupt the pace of the lesson

#### Positive group reminder

- verbal reminder to the class
- use to catch off-task behaviour early
- quick and positive
- corrects behaviours you see and those you do not
- use to describe what you want to see
- use as few words as possible

#### Anonymous group reminder

- slightly more invasive than a positive group reminder 
- makes it clear that not all pupils are complying
- still anonymous because you do not identify the pupils

7. Ask:

- why should we choose least-invasive interventions first?
- how do these techniques support a positive learning environment?

Answers may include:

- they support positive relationships - pupils do not feel singled out or embarrassed
- keeps the climate positive
- focuses on what you want to see rather than any negatives
- allows you to hold pupils to high expectations

### Putting it into practice (30 minutes)

1. Share or model these example instructions for your ECTs.

“OK class I need to see everyone looking this way in 5, pens down in 4, 3, arms on the table, 2 and eyes on me.”

Ask ECTs: Would these instructions be clear to pupils? How?

2. Explain that these instructions:

- indicates visible compliance 
- provide a time frame for pupils
- specifically telling pupils what you want to see
- focus on the positive rather than the negative
- are concrete instructions

3. Ask ECTs to work in pairs or groups to practise some example scripts.

They should:

- stand up when they’re playing the teacher
- practise each script and provide feedback
- swap roles so that everyone gets chance to practise

### Example scripts

#### Non-verbal

“OK class I need to see everyone looking this way in 5, pens down in 4, 3, arms on the table, 2 and eyes on me 1.”

(Scan the room and indicate pens down to pupils)

“Great. I can see I have 100 per cent attention.”

#### Positive group reminder

“OK class I need to see everyone looking this way in 5, pens down in 4, 3, arms on the table, 2 and eyes on me. I need to see all eyes on me, that’s it.”

#### Anonymous group reminder

“OK class I need to see everyone looking this way in 5, pens down in 4, 3, arms on the table, 2 and eyes on me. I need to see all eyes on me. I am waiting for 2 people. Great."

4. Ask the ECTs to script their own non-verbal signal, positive group reminder, and anonymous group reminder.

They should practise these in their pairs or groups and offer feedback.

Each ECT should then revise their script if needed and re-practise.

5.	Give the ECTs the following scenario.

> Imagine you have just given your class instructions for a task. You’re looking around the room to see who’s getting started. You end by saying “pick up your pens and make a start”.

Ask the ECTs to script the least-invasive correction they would give for the following scenarios:

- 1 pupil is not getting started and is leaning back on their chair
- 5 pupils are chatting and not getting started

### Planning for action (15 minutes)

Ask the ECTs to discuss or note one or two actions they’ll take into their classroom following this session.
