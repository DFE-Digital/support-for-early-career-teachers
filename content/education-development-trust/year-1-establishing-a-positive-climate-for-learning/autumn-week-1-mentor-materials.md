## Setting the scene and understanding your role in establishing positive behaviour

### Intended outcomes

The intended outcomes of this topic are for Early Career Teachers to:

Learn that:

- Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture
- Establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment

Learn how to develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:

- Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions
- Checking pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins
- Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions
- Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

### Activities

### Reflecting on learning (20 minutes)

Guidance to mentors:

- The ECT should have read the ‘Understanding the evidence’ section of the self-directed study materials ahead of the topic.
- The mentor should also read them to familiarise themselves with the content.
- When discussing the importance of building an effective climate for learning, the ECT might present the following misconceptions that new teachers can hold about the professional relationship they have with pupils:
    - As a teacher I should strive to be liked by all pupils or be the pupils’ friend
    - If I am ‘strict’ I cannot be caring
- It is important that these are addressed and clarified. Use the materials from the subject study materials to support with this.
- In this portion of the mentor topic, the mentor will ask questions to check the ECT’s understanding of what they have read. The guidance below provides a full range of responses that show understanding. However, the mentor should not treat this as a ‘test’ of the ECT’s knowledge; use the prompts to elicit fuller answers or clarify if they have misunderstood any aspect.

In this first session, the mentor should explain to the ECT the importance of beginning the mentor sessions
with a shared understanding of this Block. Go through the questions with the ECT:

Why is it important to create a predictable learning environment?

- A predictable environment is a safe one
- Pupils know what to expect
- Reduces pupil anxiety
- Pupils understand expectations
- Especially important for SEND pupils – gives them routine and stability
- Reduces pupils’ cognitive load and frees space for learning
- Maximises learning time.

How can the climate for learning support good pupil behaviour?

- A positive climate for learning is vital so that pupils can learn
- The teacher is in control of the climate for learning
- A good climate for learning means that poor behaviour is less likely to happen
- Pupils know what is expected of them
- Clear rules and routines are habitual
- Pupils know the rules and routines and are more likely to follow these.

What would you expect to see in a classroom where behaviour management is working well?

- Calm, purposeful learning environment
- Pupils are able to learn
- Pupils following routines
- Rewards and sanctions are issued consistently, and pupils are familiar with these
- Teacher positively reinforcing routines with verbal and non-verbal interactions
- Instructions are manageable and sequential
- Teacher uses consistent language to support routines
- Low-level disruption is dealt with quickly in the least-intrusive way possible
- Teacher responds quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.

What can you do to build positive relationships with your pupils?

- It is important to build positive relationship with pupils from the outset
- To do this you should learn names quickly, get to know pupils as individuals and show pupils that you listen and respect them
- Talk to colleagues, parents and carers to get a better understanding of the pupil

How would you define a culture of respect and trust in your classroom? What does a classroom that has this culture look like?

- The environment is positive and calm
- Pupils feel like the teacher treats them fairly
- Pupils feel supported
- Pupils trust the teacher to listen to them, show them what to do and help them learn
- The teacher trusts pupils to behave well
- Pupils follow the rules and routines
- The teacher shows the pupils that they can achieve success.

### Using positive reinforcement (5 minutes)

Pose the question: How can you use positive reinforcement to support behaviour?

- Narrate the positive things you see happening to make your expectations clear
 - Praise pupils who are doing the right thing
- Keeps the environment positive because you are focusing on what you want to see.

Mentor and ECT to have a go at re-writing the following sentences to make them focus on the behaviour you want to see. The first one is an example to discuss together.

1. I can’t hear silence – I want to hear silence in 3, 2, 1.<br>
2. Stop talking <br>
3. I can’t see you doing your work <br>

### Making our instructions clear (20 minutes)  

If we do not make our instructions clear, pupils can become confused, are more likely to engage in off-task chatter or unwanted behaviour and will make much less effective use of learning time. 

Discuss with the ECT when they have experienced this, and what caused it. What could they have done to
improve the clarity of their instructions?

Whether a simple direction (such as what to do with their homework) or a more complex instruction (such
as how to complete a task), teachers always need to ensure that:

1. Instructions are short, clear and sequential
2. Pupils are clear about what to do and understand the instructions before they begin
3.  All pupils follow/comply with the instruction and are challenged if they do not do this
4. When undertaking the instruction, it is done so at the standard you expect
5.  They use the least intrusive interventions to deal with low-level disruptions.

Watch the video in the self-directed study materials together and consider:

- What does the teacher say?
- What does the teacher do?
- How do they use their voice?
- How do they use non-verbal cues?

###  Practice (10 minutes)

With an upcoming lesson in mind, the ECT and mentor should script and practise a clear ‘What to do’, which supports clarity of expectations and instructions. The ECT should try this twice:
- First time imagining that the pupils do what they are supposed to.
- Do it again but dealing quickly and early with two pupils who are whispering to each other instead of starting their work.

#### Example script:

When I say go, you are going to have seven minutes to solve the equation to find the value for X in pairs. Use your help sheet from last lesson to help you with this. (Economy of language makes it clear for pupils to follow. Clear time limit.)

Sam, remind me, are you working on your own? Good, you are going to be working in pairs. (Checking for understanding.)

Rachel, what do you need to do in pairs? Excellent, you are going to solve the equation to find the value for X. (Checking for understanding and reiterating instructions.)

Raul, how long do you have? Seven minutes, correct. (Checking for understanding from a variety of pupils.)

Ok go!

Well done this table who are making a great start. (Praising on task pupils.)

I can see Daniel and Shaunna are putting in a lot of effort here. Well done this table who all have their help sheets out to support them. (Encouraging pupils to use the support and making support available to everyone.)


