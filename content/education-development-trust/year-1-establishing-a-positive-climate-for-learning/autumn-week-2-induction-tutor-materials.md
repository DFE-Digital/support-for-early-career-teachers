## Training session - setting clear expectations

Duration: 30 minutes

### Session objectives

Demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations, by:

- 1f Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations (for example, for contributions, volume level and concentration)

Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by: 

- 7c Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions

Establish effective routines and expectations, by: 

- 7j Reinforcing routines (for example, by articulating the link between time on task and success)

### Session structure

#### Giving instructions (5 minutes)

Welcome participants and explain that they’re going to focus on the following three ECF statements:

I) Demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations, by:

- 1f Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations (for example, for contributions, volume level and concentration)

II) Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:

- 7c Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions

III) Establish effective routines and expectations, by:

- 7j Reinforcing routines (e.g. by articulating the link between time on task and success)

#### Think-pair-share activity

Ask, how do you keep pupil attention when you’re giving instructions?

Allow:

- 30 seconds for ECTs to think
- 1 minute for sharing with a neighbour or group

Take feedback and share with the wider group.

Answers might include:

- giving the rationale behind the instructions 
- using tone
- adapting body language
- checking for understanding

Explain that today’s session will look at strategies to keep pupils engaged while giving instructions.

ECTs will be looking at how to set clear expectations and hold pupils to account for any listening 	they’re asked to do.

### Holding pupils to account (10 minutes)

Ask the ECTs to discuss the following statement in pairs or groups:

> It’s important to give pupils an ‘agenda for listening’. That means holding pupils to account to make sure they listen to us when we need them to.

Take feedback.

Discuss the following ways we can set an agenda for listening for our pupils:

- setting clear rules and expectations
- begin by telling pupils what they’ll be doing when you finish talking so they can make the link themselves
- telling pupils why what you’re telling them is important
- telling pupils what they need to listen for

Ask ECTs to discuss:

- how often do you use these strategies? 
- which do you find useful?

Share the following examples with the group.

I) I’m going to explain how I want you to complete this task. Once I’ve finished talking to you, you’re going to have a go on your own.

II)	The way you move from the carpet and back to your chairs is important because if you move quietly and quickly, it shows me that you’re ready to learn. The quicker you get back to your seat, the quicker we can move on with our learning.

Ask the ECTs to discuss:

- how is the teacher setting an agenda for listening for their pupils?
- what impact might this have?

### Putting it into practice (10 minutes)

Ask the ECTs to choose one of their routines. They need to script an agenda for listening for the routine instructions. They should include how they’ll hold pupils to account and make sure they listen to the instructions given.

ECTs should share these with each other and provide feedback.

### Delivery (5 minutes)

Ask the ECTs to annotate their script with instructions for how they’ll deliver it.

They should consider the following.

#### Clarity

- when will they pause for effect? 
- their pace, speak precisely or more slowly 
- repeating key words

#### Voice

- varying tone 
- enthusiasm 
- stressing key words

#### Body language

- eye contact 
- where they’ll stand in the classroom
- gestures
