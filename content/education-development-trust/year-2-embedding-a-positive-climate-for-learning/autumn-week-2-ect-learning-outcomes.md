### In your notepad

#### Key questions

1. What are intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and what might these look like in the classroom?
2. If pupils are largely motivated by extrinsic reasons, does this mean that they will not do as well?
3. How can you support pupils to be more intrinsically motivated?
4. How are success and motivation linked?
