## Training session - motivating pupils

Duration: 60 minutes

### Session objectives

### Learn that:

- 7.6. Pupils are motivated by intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values) and extrinsic factors (related to reward).

### Learn how to:

Motivate pupils by:

- 7m. Supporting pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards long-term goals.
- 7n. Providing opportunities for pupils to articulate their long-term goals and helping them to see how these are related to their success in school.

### How to prepare for the session

### Session structure:

### Introduction to the session (5 minutes) 

Welcome participants and explain which objectives this session will focus on.

### What are pupils motivated by? (10 minutes)

Ask ECTs:

- what motivates them in their day to day life?
- would they consider themselves to be intrinsically or extrinsically motivated?

Recap the meanings of these terms:

- intrinsic motivation relates to their identity and values
- extrinsic motivation relates to reward

Ask ECTs to reflect on their pupils and ask:

- what motivates them?
- how are intrinsic and extrinsic motivation linked?

### How do long term goals support motivation with challenging content? (10 minutes)

Ask ECTs to list reasons pupils might not want to attempt a task.

Answers might include:

- they cannot see the value in it
- they think it’s too challenging
- they think it’s too easy

Ask: why may pupils particularly need motivation for challenging content?

Answers might include:

- it can feel demoralising to get things wrong
- they may not know how to start
- pupils may not want to let their peers know they’re struggling

Ask ECTs to consider how setting a long-term goal might help pupils to address these issues.

Answers might include:

- focusing pupil attention on a bigger goal so they’re motivated for the smaller steps
- increases motivation to do challenging work when they know where they’re heading
- increases pupil interest in a challenging task or content because they know why they’re doing it
- offers purpose
- shows pupils the progress they’re making

Share the following scenario:

Teacher: OK Jack, so your goal is to improve your reading. I think this will really help you.

Pupil: Umm OK, I guess so.

Teacher: Great, let’s check in next week and see how you’re getting on.

Ask ECTs:

- do you think Jack views this as his long-term goal?
- do you think Jack is motivated to work towards this goal?
- what could be an issue here?

Answers might include:

- Jack does not have control over setting his goal so he might not be invested in it
- clear milestones have not been set
- Jack may not be clear on what he needs to do to improve his reading
- Jack may not see why he needs to improve his reading

Now look at this alternative scenario:

Teacher: OK Jack, so we’re going to work together to come up with a goal to support your learning. Can you start by telling me one of your strengths?

Jack: Maths. I think I’m doing well in maths.

Teacher: I would agree, you’re working brilliantly in maths. In particular I’m impressed with how well you’ve learned all your times tables recently. Can you now tell me one area you find trickier?

Jack: Ummmm I guess English?

Teacher: OK so I would suggest you think about setting a goal to help you in English. Let’s try to narrow down our focus a bit more. Is there anything in particular that you think would help you to improve in English?

Jack: Hmmmm, maybe reading?

Teacher: Great. Let’s have a go at phrasing that as a goal.

Ask ECTs:

- what's the difference here?
- how might the impact differ?

### Putting this into practice (15 minutes) 

Ask ECTs: Why do goals need to be challenging and specific rather than vague and broad?

Answers might include:

- helping pupils to succeed 
- supporting pupils
- improving performance  

ECTs should pick 3 of their pupils and decide what a meaningful long-term goal would be for each of them.

They should note how:

- they're going to help pupils articulate their goal
- the goal will support them to succeed in school
- the goal will help to motivate them

### Supporting pupils to master challenging content (15 minutes)

Explain that long-term goals show pupils where they’re going, but we need to:

- break these into steps for them
- set challenging content to help them achieve their goals

Ask ECTS to pick one of the pupils they’ve been considering and complete these tasks:

- break the long-term goal into achievable milestones
- decide how they’ll direct pupil action to meet these
- decide how they’ll highlight progress

ECTs should look at an upcoming lesson and annotate if and where they’ve:

- matched tasks clearly to learning intentions
- set tasks that will develop pupils’ knowledge
- set tasks that will develop pupils’ skills
- made links between the skills pupils have used previously that they can draw on for a new task
- supported pupils to master skills and key knowledge before moving on to the next task
- ensured pupils have a deep understanding of the key content

Ask ECTs to work in pairs and discuss:

- how is the pupils’ long term goal being addressed in the content?
- how many things from the list have they included?
- how will this motivate pupils?
- what one thing do they need to focus on when planning their next lesson?

### Priorities and next steps (5 minutes)

ECTs should think about what they’ve learned in this session and how they’ll use this in their classrooms.

Ask ECTs to identify one thing they’ll now try in their teaching:

- during the next few days
- over the next few weeks
