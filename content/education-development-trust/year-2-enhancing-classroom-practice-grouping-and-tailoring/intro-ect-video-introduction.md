Video transcript.


  In Year 1, you completed Block 3 ‘Developing effective classroom practice

‒

  
  teaching and adapting’. We focused on pedagogy and what it means to be an
  ‘effective’ teacher. You spent time in that Block learning about
  evidence-informed classroom practices such as breaking down material into
  small steps, high-quality expositions and scaffolding. You also learned about
  adapting your teaching practice ‘in the moment’ so that all of your pupils can
  learn and make progress.



  You have had a whole year to embed these skills and no doubt you will have had
  many successes. Becoming an effective teacher takes time and it is important
  you continue to practise and improve these core techniques. 



  This Block aims to enhance your understanding of ‘effectiveness’ by moving
  beyond this repertoire of techniques, where you were mainly focused on your
  own actions as teacher and how they correspond with your pupils’ learning. 



  First of all, we broaden the range of ways you engage with pupils beyond ‘a
  pupil’ and ‘the class’ by considering how you can effectively group your
  pupils to maximise learning and progress. Group and pair work can be an
  important strategy to help pupils learn and it is likely that you already make
  use of these types of collaborative activities in your teaching. In this Block
  we will consider

<i>
  how
</i>

  
  to make these activities truly effective, and in particular how to avoid
  common pitfalls such as wasting learning time, pupils losing focus or becoming
  disruptive and –
 
  most importantly –
 
  how to make sure they are actually

<i>
  learning
</i>
 through these activities. 


  There is considerable evidence to support the idea that pupils working
  collaboratively can improve outcomes. Beyond this, there are many other
  benefits to be had from pupils working together –
 
  they get an opportunity to develop social skills and learn from one another.
  However, doing this effectively takes skill and this Block will provide you
  with techniques you can use to ensure the collaborative work you ask pupils to
  do is high quality. 



  We will also consider what influence you can have on learning outside of
  school through homework. We’ll consider the evidence in this area for pupils
  of different ages and think about the type of homework which actually leads to
  educational gains. 



  You will also look at how to adapt your teaching ‘in the moment’ ensuring that
  you meet the needs of your pupils without creating lots of unnecessary extra
  work for yourself. You are also encouraged to be more alert to the impact the
  actions you take have on your pupils. By the end of this Block, you will have
  covered all of the foundations which you need to be an effective teacher.
