## The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

### Learn that:

- Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.
- SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils.

### Learn how to develop an understanding of different pupil needs, by:

- Working closely with the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO) and special education professionals and the Designated Safeguarding Lead.
- Using the SEND Code of Practice, which provides additional guidance on supporting pupils with SEND effectively.
