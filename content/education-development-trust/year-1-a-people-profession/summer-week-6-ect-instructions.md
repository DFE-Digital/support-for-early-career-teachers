- Use this time to plan and carry out observations or be observed by colleagues.
- Observations need only be for a small part of a lesson and should focus on specific aspects of classroom practice.
- Record what you plan to do yourself in your practice as a result.
- You could use video to carry out your observations. Videoing your lessons gives you the opportunity to review what is happening in your classroom and see for yourself which strategies are most effective. You can share the video with your mentor.
