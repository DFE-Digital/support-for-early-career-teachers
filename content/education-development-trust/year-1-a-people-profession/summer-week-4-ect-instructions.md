- The ideas for practice below will help you work effectively with TAs and other adults.
- Six ideas for practice are given. Choose two or three of these to try.
- Implementing the ideas for practice will require some additional planning either individually or in collaboration with colleagues.
- You should also evaluate their effectiveness and impact in discussion with your mentor.

### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

####Learn that

- Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.
- Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
- SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils.

####Learn how to develop an understanding of different pupil needs, by:

- Working closely with the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO) and special education professionals and the Designated Safeguarding Lead.

####Learn how to build trusting relationships, by:

- Liaising with parents, carers and colleagues to better understand pupilsâ€™ individual circumstances and how they can be supported to meet high academic and behavioural expectations.
- Responding consistently to pupil behaviour.
