### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

####Learn that:
- Pupils’ investment in learning is also driven by their prior experiences and perceptions of success and failure.
- Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success.
- Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
- SENCO’s, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils.

####Learn how to communicate a belief in the academic potential of all pupils, by:
- Seeking opportunities to engage parents and carers in the education of their children (e.g. proactively highlighting successes).

####Learn how to build effective working relationships, by:
- Communicating with parents and carers proactively and making effective use ofparents’ evenings to engage parents and carers in their children’s schooling.
