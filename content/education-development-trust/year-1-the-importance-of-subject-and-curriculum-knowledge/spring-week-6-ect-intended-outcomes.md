### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

#### Learn that:

- Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively. - Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed.
- Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable.
- Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial.
- Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines.

#### Learn how to deliver a carefully sequenced and coherent curriculum, by:

- Working with experienced colleagues to accumulate and refine a collection of powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations and demonstrations
- Using resources and materials aligned with the school curriculum (e.g. textbooks or shared resources designed by experienced colleagues that carefully sequence content)
- Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts
