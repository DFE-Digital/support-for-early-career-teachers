- There are three areas for you to develop your classroom practice.
- Click on each one to go to a summary of what you will learn, what success looks like and ideas for practice.
- Select one of the ideas for practice from each area to try out in your classroom.
- This will require some additional planning either individually or in collaboration with a colleague.
- You should also evaluate the effectiveness and impact of this in discussion with your mentor.

## The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

### Learn that:

- Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively.
- Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils' confidence and help them succeed.
- Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable.
- Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial.
- In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.

### Learn how to deliver a carefully sequenced and coherent curriculum, by:

- Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts.

### Learn how to support pupils to build increasingly complex mental models, by:

- Discussing curriculum design with experienced colleagues and balancing exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge.
