The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to learn that:

* working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload
* scaffolding self-assessment by sharing model work with pupils, highlighting key details
* working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to marking and alternative approaches to providing feedback. For example, using whole class feedback or well supported peer- and self-assessment
* reducing the opportunity cost of marking. For example, using abbreviations and codes in written feedback
