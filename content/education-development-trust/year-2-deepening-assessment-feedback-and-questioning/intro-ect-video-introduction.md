Video transcript.


  As an NQT last year, you completed Block 5, which introduced you to what good
  assessment, feedback and questioning are.

Remember: 

  assessment is the link between teaching and learning – it is how we find out
  the extent to which pupils have learned what we have taught them and identify
  any misconceptions they may hold. It gives us information which helps us
  respond to pupils through further teaching or feedback that pupils can act on.
  Effective assessment should always drive pupil learning.



  No doubt, you have created brilliant assessment tasks and issued high-quality,
  purposeful, personalised feedback which has supported teaching and learning.



  It is important to remember that assessment can be part of existing
  interactions with pupils and therefore not add to your workload.  In Block 5,
  you explored how to ensure your assessment always matches the objectives,
  which will have saved you time and made sure the data you gather is always
  useful and practical. You probably still have moments when assessment takes up
  much of your time - planning, facilitating and marking - but this is
  undoubtedly something that will be refined and improved over time. In this
  Block, you will be encouraged to work with your colleagues to find more
  efficient approaches which will support you to manage your workload further. 



  Now in Year 2, we will support you to build on your learning and initial
  successes by deepening your knowledge in this area and developing further
  practical strategies. You will go beyond looking at what makes effective
  assessment to focus on how you can link assessment to metacognitive
  strategies. This builds on the work you did in Block 3 in this area. 



  You will also look at how to ensure feedback is of high quality: that it is
  specific, helpful, and drives learning forward. You will look in detail at
  strategies you can use to scaffold self-assessments, to provide model work
  that supports learning, and to always ensure you are giving effective verbal
  feedback. 



  We will also spend some time looking specifically at peer- and
  self-assessment. These strategies are often presented as a way to increase
  efficiency. However, the time saved is just time wasted unless pupils are
  doing this really well! You will explore how you can structure and facilitate
  self- and peer-assessment so it can be a valuable tool within the classroom.
