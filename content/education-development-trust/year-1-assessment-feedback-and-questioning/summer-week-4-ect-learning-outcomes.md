## The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

### Learn that:

- Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupilsâ€™ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.
- High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.

### Learn how to meet individual needs without creating unnecessary workload, by:

- Reframing questions to provide greater scaffolding or greater stretch.

### Learn how to stimulate pupil thinking and check for understanding, by:

- Including a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils (e.g. by modelling new vocabulary or asking pupils to justify answers).

### Learn how to check prior knowledge and understanding during lessons, by:

- Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions).
