### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

#### Learn that:

- Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupilsâ€™ understanding and needs.
- Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.
- Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.
- To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.
- High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve.
