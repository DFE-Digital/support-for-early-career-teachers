- Use this time to plan and carry out some observations of colleagues or be observed yourself. Record what you plan to do yourself in your practice as a result.
- In your mentor session 5.6, you will have a chance to reflect on what you learn from observing other colleagues or being observed yourself.
- You might choose to observe or be observed on one of the suggested foci or on a range of the foci.
- Use the suggested observation ideas to plan your observations. You don’t need to do all of them but choose the one(s) that you feel will be most helpful – your mentor can help you plan this.
- You could use video to carry out your observations. Videoing your lessons gives you the opportunity to review what is happening in your classroom and see for yourself which strategies are most effective. You can share the video with your mentor.
