2. School input as needed.
3. Relevant conversations with colleagues.

## Session structure:

### Welcome and recap (10 minutes)

Provide a relevant recap on previously taught content, particularly the training session 5 which focused on teacher wellbeing.

Set up the norms for this session.

### What is pupil wellbeing? (20 minutes)

You could:

- introduce why pupil wellbeing is essential for academic success
- introduce or recap school policies that support this, covering areas such as pupil safety, child protection and safety online
- define the term ‘wellbeing’ as being able to cope with social, physical and psychological demands placed on pupils through building and sustaining a predictable and secure environment for learning to take place
- consider the impact that a lack of wellbeing can have on pupils’ capacity to learn

### How can pupil wellbeing be considered in the classroom? (15 minutes)

You could consider:

- how pupils are grouped within a class, and how this impacts their motivation and engagement
- how groupings or seating plans might affect pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation
- what support is put in place, particularly for any special educational needs of low attaining pupils, while maintaining high academic expectations for all pupils and providing access to a rich curriculum
- asking ECTs to reflect on amendments they could make to groupings or provision of support in their current classes

### Who else can help to support pupil wellbeing? (35 minutes)

You could:

- consider the importance of a relationship with parents and carers when considering pupils' wellbeing
- look at the role that parents can play in their child’s academic success, and how to engage with families and carers to support pupils
- discuss the roles of the school SENCO, DSL and pastoral leaders, and the valuable expertise and information they can provide about pupils
- explore the explicit links between interventions inside and outside of the classroom
- ask ECTs to identify a pupil who could be supported more in their classroom, and plan what contact could be made with parents, carers, the SENCO and others so that further provision can be put in place

### Action planning and next steps (10 minutes)

This section provides ECTs with time for reflection, quizzing, and action steps. Teachers could be encouraged to identify specific steps they’ll take to implement their learning.
