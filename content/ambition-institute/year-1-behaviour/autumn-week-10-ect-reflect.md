## Reminder of key takeaways


  Ms Silva can promote behaviours that support independent practice if she
  understands that:

- pupils need to understand the long-term benefits of practice, even if it feels hard 
- to practise independently, pupils need enough support and clear behavioural expectations. Teachers also need to check pupil understanding of support and expectations 
- pupils need to be held to account to practise independently

## Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the 'key takeaways' do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
