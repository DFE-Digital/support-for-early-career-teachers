## Positive learning environment

### Select a development area

Consider the development areas for this topic (below). Then make a note of the area you plan to zoom in on and when you plan to visit so you can observe your teacher in this area. Familiarise yourself with the focused development areas. You will select one later when you observe your teacher.

### Development area 1: Positive role modelling

#### Focused development area

- Teacher, with the support of a colleague, identifies the behaviours they expect to see from pupils and plans how to model these.
- Teacher treats pupils with respect, role modelling the behaviours they expect pupils to adopt.
- Teacher quickly addresses and seeks to resolve instances of bullying, role modelling to pupils how to respond.

### Development area 2: Embracing error

#### Focused development area

- Teacher models to pupils how to spot errors and treat them as opportunities to learn.
- Teacher supports pupils to recognise and overcome negative emotions associated with making errors.
- Teacher ensures pupils feel safe and willing to contribute answers even if they contain errors.
- Teacher ensures pupils are focused on the thought process behind an answer, rather than simply on whether they got the answer right or not.

Example precise target: Teacher supports pupils to recognise and overcome negative emotions associated with making errors.

- **Not doing it at all:** Especially before pupils attempt work they are likely to find particularly challenging, prepare pupils by explaining that making errors can cause negative emotions, but errors are an inevitable and often useful part of learning.
- **Doing it but needs some improvement:** Especially before pupils attempt work they are likely to find particularly challenging, explain to pupils that if they experience negative emotions in response to making an error, they should recognise the emotions, slow down their thinking and focus on positive thoughts, e.g. "Making errors is a normal part of learning. I can learn from this."
- **Doing it well and needs some stretch:** Especially before pupils attempt work they are likely to find particularly challenging, model making an error, thinking aloud the negative feelings you are having, slowing down your thinking and stating positive thoughts, e.g. "Making errors is a normal part of learning. I can learn from this. ".

### Development area 3: Acknowledgement or praise

#### Focused development area

- Teacher acknowledges when pupils are meeting their expectations so that they feel noticed and to encourage others to follow suit.
- Teacher uses specific, immediate and unpredictable praise for pupils who exceed their learning goals in order to motivate them and avoid pupils becoming reliant on praise.
- Teacher praises pupils for the effort they are exerting and the positive strategies they are using to overcome negative emotions.

### Observe

Consider the following questions based on a short (approximately 15 minute) observation of your teacher.

What was your teacher’s previous target? Are they meeting it? How do you know?

- Thinking about the development area you have selected for this topic, what is your teacher already doing well in this area? Which focused development area best aligns with what your teacher needs to get better at? What one precise target (bite-sized action) might you work with them on during your mentor meeting?
- Reminder: You can choose to stick with this previous target if they have not made enough progress. When moving on to a new precise target, you can select one from the table above or, if this doesn’t fit your teacher’s needs, you can write your own.

How will you model the target to your teacher to show them what good looks like? What questions will you ask to check your teacher understands the model? For example, ‘How it is different from your current practice?’ and ‘What impact might it have on your practice and pupils?’

Reminder: Your model should help your teacher develop their ability in some of the following:

- Create a positive environment where making mistakes and learning from them and the need for effort and perseverance are part of the daily routine.
- Create a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed (e.g. by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils.)
- Acknowledge and praise pupil effort and emphasise progress being made.
- Respond quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.

Next, meet with your teacher to work through the ‘feedback’ stage of instructional coaching.
