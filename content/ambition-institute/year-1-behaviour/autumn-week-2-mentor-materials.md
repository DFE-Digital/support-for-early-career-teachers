## Routines

### Select a development area

Consider the development areas for this topic (below). Then make a note of the area you plan to zoom in on and when you plan to visit so you can observe your teacher in this area. Familiarise yourself with the focused development areas. You will select one later when you observe your teacher.

### Development area 1: Entry routine

#### Focused development area 

- Teacher greets pupils as they enter the classroom. 
- Teacher ensures pupils know what to do as they enter the classroom. 
- Teacher manages the flow of pupils into the classroom and restates the instructions so pupils are clear what they need to do. 
- Teacher ensures pupils know they are accountable for following instructions as they enter the classroom. 
- Teacher diagnoses pupils' emotions as they enter the room and responds appropriately, e.g. by privately addressing a pupil if necessary.

Example precise target: Teacher greets pupils as they enter the classroom.

- **Not doing it at all:** When pupils are entering the classroom, deliver a greeting either individually or to the class and in line with your school's policy.
- **Doing it but needs some improvement:** When greeting pupils, use open body language to match your warm tone and language. 
- **Doing it well and needs some stretch:** When appropriate, add personalised greeting tailored to individual pupils to help them feel welcome and motivated to learn.

- Teacher models what the routine looks like so pupils know exactly how the routine needs to be carried out. 
- Teacher ensures pupils know they are accountable for doing the routine. 
- Teacher positively encourages pupils to embed the routine as a habit.

### Observe

Consider the following questions based on a short (approximately 15 minute) observation of your teacher:

* what was your teacher’s previous target?
* are they meeting it?
* how do you know?

Thinking about the development area you have selected for this topic, what is your teacher already doing well in this area? Which focused development area best aligns with what your teacher needs to get better at? What one precise target (bite-sized action) might you work with them on during your mentor meeting?

You can choose to stick with this previous target if they have not made enough progress. 

When moving on to a new precise target, you can select one from the table above or, if this doesn’t fit your teacher’s needs, you can write your own.

How will you model the target to your teacher to show them what good looks like? What questions will you ask to check your teacher understands the model? For example, ‘How it is different from your current practice?’ and ‘What impact might it have on your practice and pupils?’

Your model should help your teacher develop their ability in some of the following:

- explicitly teach routines and behavioural expectations
- model routines and behavioural expectations
- practise routines with their pupils
- give manageable, specific and sequential instructions
- use consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions
- create a positive and motivating climate in the classroom

Next, meet with your teacher to work through the ‘feedback’ stage of instructional coaching.
