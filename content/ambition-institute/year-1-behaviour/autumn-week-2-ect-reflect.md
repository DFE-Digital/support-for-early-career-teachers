### Reminder of key takeaways
Mr Price can use routines to establish positive behaviour for learning by understanding
that:
- routines can create a positive and motivating climate in the classroom 
- high expectations can improve pupil behaviour at both a classroom and school level 
- for routines to take hold expectations must be clearly communicated and modelled 
- for routines to stick they need to be revised, re-practised and reinforced




### Reflect on the following questions
1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms? 
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
