## Reminder of key takeaways

Teachers can create a positive environment where behaviour promotes learning by understanding that:

- teacher expectations affect pupil attitudes, values and behaviours, and therefore influence learning outcomes
- teachers are role-models for pupils. What teachers say and do will influence pupil behaviour, attitudes and values
- teachers can promote pupil behaviour which is resilient and motivated by developing pupil emotional self-regulation. This means they have a healthy approach to failure as part of the learning process and also ensures pupils regularly experience meaningful success

## Reflect on the following questions:

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the 'key takeaways' do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
