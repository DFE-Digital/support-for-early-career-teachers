### Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Sterling can support pupils to be more open to challenge if she
understands:

- pupil motivation is driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, prior experiences and perceptions of success
- teachers who give pupils experiences of success build not only motivation but also resilience and belief in their ability to succeed
- teachers with knowledge of how pupils learn can better balance challenge and support and promote pupil success, which makes them open to challenge

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
