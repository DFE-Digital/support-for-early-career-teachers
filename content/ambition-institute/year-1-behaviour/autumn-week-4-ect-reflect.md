### Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Silva can direct pupil attention and increase learning by understanding that:

- self-regulation and pupil motivation can affect how pupils direct their attention, which naturally wanders over time
- proactively monitoring, modelling and reinforcing helps direct pupil attention and keep them on task
- when reinforcement is positively framed it makes pupils feel safe and creates a more productive learning environment
- teachers can redirect attention in the least intrusive ways. But if action taken by the teacher is sometimes clearly visible, pupils can feel that their teacher is more effective and experience a stronger sense of shared classroom values

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other
   classrooms?

2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?

3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
