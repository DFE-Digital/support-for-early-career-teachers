## Instructions

### Select a development area

Consider the development areas for this topic (below). Then make a note of the area you plan to zoom in on and when you plan to visit so you can observe your teacher in this area. Familiarise yourself with the focused development areas. You will select one later when you observe your teacher.

### Development areas 1: Presence through posture

#### Focused development area

- Teacher stands still when speaking to the class.
- Teacher adopts a confident, composed and open posture.
- Teacher gives instructions from the same spot in the classroom that allows for good visibility of the class.

### Development areas 2: Deliver clear instructions

#### Focused development area

- Teacher delivers instructions that are manageable and sequential.
- Teacher delivers instructions that detail the specific actions they need pupils to take.
- Teacher checks pupils know what to do by having them repeat the instructions.

Example precise target: Teacher delivers instructions that are manageable and sequential.

- **Not doing it at all:** Break down and deliver instructions in manageable steps.
- **Doing it but needs some improvement:** Break down and deliver instructions in manageable steps that are ordered sequentially for pupils, e.g. by numbering each step.
- **Doing it well and needs some stretch:**Break down and deliver instructions in manageable steps that are ordered sequentially for pupils. Pause briefly between each step so pupils have time to take in each part of your instructions.

### Development areas 3: Presence through voice

#### Focused development area

- Teacher is using the appropriate register and pace to match the content of the instructions.
- Teacher maintains control of their emotions, speaking at the appropriate volume and with the appropriate tone.

### Observe

Consider the following questions based on a short (approximately 15 minute) observation of your teacher.

- What was your teacher’s previous target? Are they meeting it? How do you know?

- Thinking about the development area you have selected for this topic, what is your teacher already doing well in this area? Which focused development area best aligns with what your teacher needs to get better at? What one precise target (bite-sized action) might you work with them on during your mentor meeting?

Reminder: You can choose to stick with this previous target if they have not made enough progress. When moving on to a new precise target, you can select one from the table above or, if this doesn’t fit your teacher’s needs, you can write your own.

How will you model the target to your teacher to show them what good looks like? What questions will you ask to check your teacher understands the model? For example, ‘how it is different from your current practice?’ and ‘What impact might it have on your practice and pupils?’

Reminder: Your model should help your teacher develop their ability in some of the following:

- Use consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.
- Give manageable, specific and sequential instructions.
- Make the steps in a process memorable and ensure pupils can recall them.
- Deliver instructions using appropriate volume and tone of voice.

Next, meet with your teacher to work through the ‘feedback’ stage of instructional coaching.
