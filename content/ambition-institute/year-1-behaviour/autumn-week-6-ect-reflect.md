## Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Mahrez can improve the effectiveness of her classroom by understanding that:

- consistency entails predictably modelling and enforcing classroom systems. It is most effective when positive reinforcement moves pupils towards intrinsic motivation
- consistency can improve teacher-pupil relationships and school culture by promoting shared values
- over time, consistently enabling pupils to be successful can improve pupil wellbeing, motivation, behaviour and academic outcomes

## Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the 'key takeaways' do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
