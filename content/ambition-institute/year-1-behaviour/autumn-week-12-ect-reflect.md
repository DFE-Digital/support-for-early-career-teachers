### Reminder of key takeaways:

- high expectations are achieved through learning environments which demand lots from pupils but also ensure they experience success
- experiencing success improves pupil effort, confidence and motivation
- pupils can improve their self-regulation and so their behaviour and learning
- teachers who promote academic success also make pupil success beyond the classroom more likely

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
