## Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Sterling can make learning more manageable for pupils by understanding
that:

- when academic demands are not well matched to pupil capabilities, pupils’ working memory can become overloaded, causing them to stop trying or go off-task
- introducing new material in steps, building on prior knowledge and using guides and scaffolds all help to avoid overloading pupils’ working memory and make it more likely that pupils will stay on-task

## Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
