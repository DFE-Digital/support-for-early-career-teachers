### ECF ‘Learn that’ statements covered

- 5.7: Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.
- 8.5: Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
- 8.6: SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils.

### ECF 'Learn how to’ statements covered

Develop an understanding of different pupil needs by:

- 5c: Working closely with the SENCO and special education professionals and the Designated Safeguarding Lead
- 5d: Using the SEND Code of Practice, which provides additional guidance on supporting pupils with SEND effectively.

Provide an opportunity for all pupils to experience success by:

- 5g: Working closely with the SENCO and other professionals supporting pupils with additional needs, making explicit links between interventions delivered outside of lessons with classroom teaching.

Meet individual needs without creating unnecessary workload by:

- 5h: Making use of well-designed resources (such as textbooks).

Build effective working relationships by:

- 8f: Contributing positively to the wider school culture and developing a feeling of shared responsibility for improving the lives of all pupils within the school.
- 8i: Working closely with the SENCO and other professionals supporting pupils with additional needs, making explicit links between interventions delivered outside of lessons with classroom teaching.
