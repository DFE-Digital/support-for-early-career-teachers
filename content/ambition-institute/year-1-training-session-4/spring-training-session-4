Duration: 90 minutes.

## Outcomes

1. To know what ‘adaptive teaching’ means.
2. To understand the importance of how pupils are grouped.
3. To learn that adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils, or to set lower expectations for some pupils.
4. To know that different pupils, including pupils with SEND, are likely to require additional or adapted support and strategies.
5. To learn that the teacher will need to plan and work with other staff and parents to achieve this.
6. To reflect on and share how to respond to pupil needs.
7. To reflect on the implications on their teaching, planning, and their own development.

Before this session takes place, early career teachers (ECTs) should have the following:

- Exposure to key knowledge from ITT Core Content Framework on relevant sub-standards.
- School input as needed.
- Relevant conversations with colleagues.

## Session structure: 

### Welcome and recap (10 minutes)

Provide a relevant recap on previously taught content. Set up the norms for the session.

### What is adaptive teaching? (20 minutes)

This time can be used to:

- introduce the concept of adaptive teaching
- include information about how adaptive teaching varies depending on the learning needs of pupils
- emphasise the importance of using formative assessment to identify these needs
- talk about what adaptive teaching is not (for example, adapting lessons based on a belief that pupils have distinct learning styles)

### Why is it important? (20 minutes)

You could:

- ensure buy-in from ECTs on why being responsive in this way is important
- consider the impact of adapting lessons so that pupils can experience success and see that ability is not fixed, which can increase motivation towards learning
- introduce the importance of adapting quality-first teaching as the first step in responding to pupils with SEND within the tiered approach to educational support

### What strategies can be adopted to help pupils? (30 minutes)

You could:

- introduce examples and non-examples of adapting teaching for pupils
- include opportunities for ECTs to reflect on their own current practice and practice they’ve seen
- include concrete strategies around grouping, planning new content, using formative assessment and resources
- provide an opportunity for ECTs to practise one of the strategies shown
- look at how to work effectively with teaching assistants (TAs)

### Action planning and next steps (10 minutes) 

This section provides ECTs with time for reflection, quizzing, and action steps. You can also look ahead to the next training steps. 

## Related ECF strands

### ECF 'Learn that’ statements covered

- 4.10. How pupils are grouped is important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.
- 5.4. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.
- 5.5. Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils.
- 5.6. There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.
- 5.7. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.

### ECF 'Learn how to’ statements covered 

Develop an understanding of different pupils’ needs by:

- 5b. Making use of formative assessment.  

Provide opportunity for all pupils to experience success by:

- 5e. Adapting lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations.
- 5f. Balancing input of new content so that pupils master important concepts.
- 5g. Making effective use of teaching assistants.

Meet individual needs without creating unnecessary workload by:

- 5h. Making use of well-designed resources (such as textbooks).
- 5i. Planning to connect new content with pupils’ existing knowledge or providing additional pre-teaching if pupils lack critical knowledge.
- 5j. Building in additional practice or removing unnecessary expositions.
- 5l. Considering carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals and small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning different lessons for different groups of pupils.

Group pupils effectively by:

- 5m. Applying high expectations to all groups, and ensuring all pupils have access to a rich curriculum.
- 5n. Changing groups regularly, avoiding the perception that groups are fixed.
- 5o. Ensuring that any groups based on attainment are subject specific.
- 1d. Seeking opportunities to engage parents and carers in the education of their children (proactively highlighting successes, for example) with support from expert colleagues to understand how this engagement changes depending on the age and development stage of the pupil.
