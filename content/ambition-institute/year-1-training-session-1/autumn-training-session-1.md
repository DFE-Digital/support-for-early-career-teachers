Provides an overview of:
- the SEND code of practice
- working with the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO) or designated safeguarding lead (DSL)
- working with teaching assistants (TAs)

Duration: 90 minutes.

## Outcomes 

1. To understand what inclusion is and what it’s not.
2. To know what roles the SENCO and the DSL have within a school context.
3. To know that the SEND code of practice states that the teacher is responsible for the progress of pupils with SEND in their classes.
4. To learn about the ‘graduated approach’ to supporting pupils with SEND, as recommended by the SEND code of practice.
5. To understand how to do the important task of building up a holistic picture of pupils with SEND, including speaking to parents, carers and the pupil.
6. To understand that high expectations are crucial when planning and working with pupils with SEND.
7. To learn that planning provision for a pupil with an Education Health and Care Plan (ECHP) still uses the graduated approach, but provision is organised around the planned outcomes written in the EHCP.
8. To reflect on and share implications for their teaching and on their own development.

## Preparation

Before this session takes place, early career teachers (ECTs) should have the following. 
1. Exposure to key knowledge from ITT Core Content Framework on relevant sub-standards.
2. School input as needed.
3. Conversations with the SENCO, the DSL, school colleagues and parents or carers on how to effectively support students with special educational needs in their classroom.

## Session structure: 

### Welcome and introduction to training sessions (10 minutes)

Use this time to introduce yourself and welcome the ECTs.

Establish ways of working for this and future sessions.

### SEND code of practice (20 minutes)

You could:
- discuss the term ‘inclusion’
- provide a definition of ‘SEND’
- highlight that special educational needs are not something the pupil needs to change about themselves, but teachers can change the environment to meet individual learning needs
- introduce the SEND code of practice and explain its significance
- explore what the SEND code of practice says about the role of teachers and the SENCO in supporting pupils with SEND
- introduce the role of the DSL in schools

### Graduated approach - assess (20 minutes) 

You could:
- introduce the ‘graduated approach’ to supporting pupils with SEND as recommended by the code of practice
- explore working with the SENCO, the DSL, parents, carers and the pupil to build a holistic picture of pupils with SEND, including identifying their prior knowledge and any potential barriers to learning
- discuss needs versus diagnosis to emphasise that understanding a pupils’ learning needs is usually more important than a diagnosis when planning support in the classroom

### Graduated approach - plan, do and review (30 minutes)

You could:
- emphasise the importance of holding high expectations for all pupils, if the graduated approach to provision is to be effective
- explore the 3 stages of the graduated approach: plan, do and review
- examine the tiered approach to educational support 
- look at an example of planning for an ECHP
- take a brief look at how to work effectively with teaching assistants (TA)

### Action planning and next steps (10 minutes)

This section provides ECTs with time for reflection, quizzing, and action steps. You can also look ahead to the next training steps.

ECF 'Learn that’ statements covered

- 5.2. Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.
- 5.3. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.
- 5.7. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.
- 8.5. TAs can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
- 8.6. SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils.

Develop an understanding of different pupil needs by:
- 5b. Making use of formative assessment.
