## Outcomes

1. Reflect on the progress made so far to identify a specific area where they could implement change, and the extent to which they’ve engaged critically with research: discussing evidence with colleagues to make evidence-informed decisions on what to implement.
2. Learn that the term ‘active ingredients’ refers to the essential principles and practices that underpin a strategy or approach.
3. Identify strategies early career teachers (ECTs) wish to trial in order to implement change, develop their practice and identify their desired outcomes.
4. Identify any gaps in knowledge or skills ECTs have in implementing this change, considering areas for professional development and where they could collaborate with and seek support from colleagues.
5. Assess the positive and negative impacts that implementing this change would have on the ECT’s workload and wellbeing.
