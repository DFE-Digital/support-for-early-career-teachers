### Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Garcia can effectively adapt her teaching if she understands that:

- adapting teaching means identifying key adaptations and deploying them responsively to ensure pupils experience a high success rate
- whole class questioning can expose what pupils understand to inform responsive teaching
- teachers need to understand key pupil differences and potential barriers to learning, especially for pupils with special educational needs or disabilities, and prepare solutions _before_ the lesson
- worked examples and careful grouping can support pupils to fill knowledge gaps or correct misconceptions

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
