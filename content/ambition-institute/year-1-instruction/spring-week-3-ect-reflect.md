### Reminder of key takeaways

Mr Alexander can ensure his instruction supports pupil memory by understanding that:

- pupils remember content they think hard about, and they can’t think if their working memory is overloaded
- teachers can support thinking by introducing material which builds on prior knowledge, breaking it up into manageable steps and using worked and partially worked examples
- as pupil knowledge increases, support can get in the way of thinking and should be removed
- opportunities to retrieve at increasingly spaced intervals promotes remembering

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
