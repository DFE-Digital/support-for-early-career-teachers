## Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Stones can deliver more effective instruction by identifying the learning content
if she understands that:

- learning is a process leading to changes in pupils' capabilities or understanding that happens when pupils think hard
- breaking learning down should make thinking manageable enough for pupils to experience a high success rate
- identifying manageable steps is tricky, so teachers should check all pupils' key learning, and provide further support to ensure a high success rate

## Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the 'key takeaways' do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
