### Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Sims can be more confident her instruction is effective if she understands that:

- explicit teaching of knowledge and skills can help form effective mental models
- effective instruction is underpinned by what we know about how pupils learn and checking this through effective assessment
- effective instruction often uses the I-We-You model to introduce new material in steps, using concrete examples and worked examples, gradually withdrawing support and promoting independent practice with a high success rate, both within lessons and over time

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
