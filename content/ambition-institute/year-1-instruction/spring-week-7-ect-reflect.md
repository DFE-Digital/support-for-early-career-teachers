### Reminder of key takeaways
Mr Andrews can support successful practice if he understands that:
- learning is about remembering and connecting information through thinking hard 
- purposeful practice which causes pupils to think hard improves their retention 
- effective instruction includes purposeful practice and regular retrieval




### Reflect on the following questions
1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms? 
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module? 
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
