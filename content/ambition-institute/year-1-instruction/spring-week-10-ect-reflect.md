### Reminder of key takeaways

To use questioning to support pupil thinking, Mr Ashwin needs to understand that:

- questioning has many purposes for teachers, including checking pupil understanding, breaking down problems and extending and challenging pupil thinking
- pupils need enough knowledge, guidance and thinking time to produce quality answers
- questioning underpins quality pupil classroom talk, especially in the ‘We do’ part of instruction

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
