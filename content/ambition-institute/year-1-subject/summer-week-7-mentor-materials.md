## Developing pupils’ literacy

### Select a development area

Consider the development areas for this topic (below). Then make a note of the area you plan to zoom in on and when you plan to visit so you can observe your teacher in this area. Familiarise yourself with the focused development areas. You will select one later when you observe your teacher.

### Development area 1: Identifying and teaching important vocabulary

#### Focused development area

- Teacher, with the support of a colleague, identifies and plans when to introduce unfamiliar high-frequency words (that pupils will use often) and high-utility words (that are particularly important in the subject) so that they are manageable for pupils.
- Teacher explicitly teaches unfamiliar high-frequency and high-utility words.
- Teacher repeatedly models unfamiliar vocabulary to support pupils to understand how these words are used.
- Teacher ensures pupils practise using the vocabulary, providing scaffolds at first and gradually removing them when pupils are increasingly successful.
- Teacher is alert to pupils using vocabulary incorrectly and addresses this at the appropriate time and in the appropriate level of depth to support them to use it correctly in future.
- Teacher pre-empts misconceptions when explaining and giving examples of how to use the vocabulary.

{details}
Example precise target: Teacher explicitly teaches unfamiliar high-frequency and high-utility words.

- **Not doing it at all:** Explicitly teach pupils an unfamiliar high-frequency and/or high-utility word by explaining what it means using words pupils are familiar with.
- **Doing it but needs some improvement:** Explicitly teach pupils an unfamiliar high-frequency and/or high-utility word by explaining what it means using words pupils are familiar with and then providing concrete examples to model how the word is used in sentences.
- **Doing it well and needs some stretch:** Once you have defined an unfamiliar high-frequency and/or high-utility word and provided concrete examples of its usage, ask pupils to practise using the word themselves in sentences they create. Check they are using the word correctly and provide feedback to support them to do so.

### Development area 2: Oral literacy

#### Focused development area

- Teacher models the usage of high-quality oral language, particularly demonstrating how to use unfamiliar high frequency and high-utility language.
- Teacher uses whole-group rehearsal to support pupils to pronounce language correctly.
- Teacher uses paired talk tasks to give pupils the opportunity to rehearse their ideas and practise using vocabulary in order to support their reading and writing.
- Teacher ensures pupils use high-quality oral language and grammar correctly.  


### Development area 3: Reading and writing

#### Focused development area

- Teacher models reading by using their voice effectively to convey meaning.
- Teacher prepares and supports pupils to access texts they will be reading.
- Teacher models reading comprehension by asking questions, making predictions and summarising.
- Teacher supports pupils to consider the way written texts in their subject have been crafted so that pupils understand and can begin to use these features and processes in their writing.
- Teacher models and explains the importance of the writing process: planning, drafting and editing, keeping the end goal in mind.

### Observe

Consider the following questions based on a short (approximately 15 minute) observation of your teacher.

- What was your teacher’s previous target? Are they meeting it? How do you know?

- Thinking about the development area you have selected for this topic, what is your teacher already doing well in this area? Which focused development area best aligns with what your teacher needs to get better at? What one precise target (bite-sized action) might you work with them on during your mentor meeting?

Reminder: You can choose to stick with this previous target if they have not made enough progress. When moving on to a new precise target, you can select one from the table above or, if this doesn’t fit your teacher’s needs, you can write your own.

How will you model the target to your teacher to show them what good looks like? What questions will you ask to check your teacher understands the model? For example, ‘How it is different from your current practice?’ and ‘What impact might it have on your practice and pupils?’

Reminder: Your model should help your teacher develop their ability in some of the following:

- Teach unfamiliar vocabulary explicitly and plan for pupils to be repeatedly exposed to high-utility and high-frequency vocabulary in what is taught.
- Model reading comprehension by asking questions, making predictions and summarising when reading.
- Model and require high-quality oral language, recognising that spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing (e.g. requiring pupils to respond to questions in full sentences, making use of relevant technical vocabulary).
- Teach different forms of writing by modelling planning, drafting and editing, narrating thought processes to make explicit how experts think.
- Provide scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of dialogue.

Next, meet with your teacher to work through the ‘feedback’ stage of instructional coaching.
