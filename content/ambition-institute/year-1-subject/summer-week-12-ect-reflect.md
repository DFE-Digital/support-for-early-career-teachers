## Reminder of key takeaways

Mr Jones can help pupils to improve their work and deepen their understanding by:

- offering feedback which guides pupils on how to improve and gives them the opportunity to apply it
- making his approach to feedback efficient and sustainable for him
- encouraging pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning

## Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
