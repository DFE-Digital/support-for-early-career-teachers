### Reminder of key takeaways
Teachers can be responsive subject teachers by understanding that:
- effective teaching develops pupils’ mental models of the subject
- effective planning is based on the school curriculum and the teacher’s subject knowledge: this allows teachers to sequence and plan teaching 
- effective planning uses and builds upon effective assessment. The information this provides guides teachers’ planning and allows them to target support through responsive teaching 
- effective planning and assessment can be&nbsp;sustainable




### Reflect on the following questions
1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms? 
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module? 
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
