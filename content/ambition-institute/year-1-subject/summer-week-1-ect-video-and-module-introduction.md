### Presenter: Chloe Wardle

Welcome to the Subject module. This module is a combination of two areas, curriculum
and assessment, because curriculum and assessment go hand in hand. The better that
teachers know what they’re teaching, the best order they should teach it in, and
the ways of strengthening what pupils know, the more they will be able to support
their pupils to develop their capabilities and understanding. This is what it means
to understand your curriculum.

But teachers also need to find ways of regularly checking how learning is going and ensure that they adapt their teaching in response. This is the role of assessment. Across this module you will develop your responses to a number of key questions. What am I teaching? How can I make that learning secure? How will I know if my pupils are getting it? And what will I do if they’re not?

### Presenter: Harry Fletcher-Wood

Curriculum involves learning about your subject in depth, its core ideas and how
they’re organised. Through access to a broad and balanced curriculum, pupils are
able to develop the knowledge, skills, and values that will enable them to succeed
in school and beyond. Understanding curriculum means understanding what you’re teaching
and the best order to teach it in. This allows you to share this learning journey
with your pupils. Thinking about the curriculum that you’re delivering is a rewarding
process, especially when you work with experienced subject specialists within your
school.

Assessment is all about checking what your pupils have understood and adapting your teaching based on what you find out. It’s one of the most fascinating areas that teachers can explore. you’ve designed this great lesson, you’ve taught it really well, but what happened? Did they get it? Do you need to go back and reteach anything? Effective assessment is about revealing pupil thinking so that you can check how learning is going.

### Presenter: Chloe Wardle

In the first half of this module, you will learn how to identify what you are teaching,
where pupils may go wrong, and how to deepen pupil understanding. In the second half
of the module, you will learn about the best ways of assessing what pupils have learned
and how to adapt your teaching in response.

Alongside a written evidence summary, there will be a video to watch each week. This will give you an overview of the content to provide a framework for your thinking. It will also provide you with a concrete model of how you might transfer some of the ideas into practice. You may choose to test out the model in a coaching session or in your teaching. When you do, remember that you will need to adapt what you see to your own context. Video models may not be subject or phase specific, depending on what you teach, but they will exemplify key ideas that are relevant to all.
