### Reminder of key takeaways

Mr Jones can reach conclusions about next steps from formative assessment if he:

- takes a systematic approach to identify patterns of understanding
- tries to understand pupils’ thinking by seeking common misconceptions and knowledge gaps, rather than just looking for the correct answer
- judges the prevalence and importance of misconceptions and knowledge gaps when deciding whether and how to adapt his teaching

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
