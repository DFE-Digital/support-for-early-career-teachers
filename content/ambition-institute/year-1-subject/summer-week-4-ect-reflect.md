## Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Brown can better tackle pupil knowledge gaps and misconceptions by understanding
that:

- a key reason for differing pupil needs is their different levels of prior knowledge
- pupils may have – or develop – misconceptions: incorrect beliefs about a topic or subject
- teachers can identify and overcome these incomplete mental models by using knowledge of subject and common misconceptions, for example to generate analogies based on existing knowledge

## Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the 'key takeaways' do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
