## Reminder of key takeaways

Mr Jones can show pupils how to succeed by:

- constructing models which show pupils what a good response or performance looks like
- directing pupils' attention to the critical aspects of those models
- using those models to promote metacognition and for feedback

## Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the 'key takeaways' do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
