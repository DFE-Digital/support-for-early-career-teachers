### Reminder of key takeaways

Mr Jones can help pupils to improve their literacy by:

- identifying literacy goals for a topic, such as vocabulary to use, challenging texts to read, and forms of writing to practise
- sharing and breaking down models of the reading and writing he hopes pupils will master
- planning opportunities for high-quality talk, which use key vocabulary to articulate crucial ideas

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
