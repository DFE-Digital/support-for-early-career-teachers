## Reminder of key takeaways

In considering how to adapt his teaching to meet pupils' needs, Mr Jones needs to
know that:

- the value of formative assessment is in allowing teachers to understand and respond to pupil needs
- targeting learning styles is ineffective and individualised tasks for all pupils are prohibitively time-consuming
- adaptations should focus on the misconceptions and knowledge gaps identified, particularly when they are common to many pupils

## Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the 'key takeaways' do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
