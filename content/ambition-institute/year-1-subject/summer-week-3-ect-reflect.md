### Reminder of key takeaways
Mr Jones can help students to develop their mental models and think more effectively
about his subject by:
- focusing on developing pupil knowledge in order to ultimately develop pupil capabilities and understanding 
- developing his mental model using available resources and reflecting on what this implies in terms of the important knowledge he wants to teach 
- prioritising types of knowledge and identifying which is critical subject content – concepts, knowledge, skills and principles – that he wants pupils to retain, while teaching enough supporting content to give pupils access to a broad and balanced curriculum




### Reflect on the following questions
1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms? 
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module? 
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
