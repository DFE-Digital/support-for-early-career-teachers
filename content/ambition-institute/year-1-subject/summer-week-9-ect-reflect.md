### Reminder of key takeaways
Mr Jones can check pupils’ developing understanding by:
- recognising that summative assessment has value but that it cannot provide rapid, detailed information about pupil understanding 
- formative assessment practices can provide valuable information about what pupils have understood and gaps in their knowledge 
- formative assessment should be designed around how the information it provides will be used




### Reflect on the following questions
1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms? 
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
