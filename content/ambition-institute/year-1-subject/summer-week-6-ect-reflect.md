### Reminder of key takeaways

Mr Jones can promote deep thinking by:

- seeing deep thinking as an extension of pupils’ mental models of the subject
- helping pupils access knowledge more flexibly
- showing pupils how to apply knowledge to new problems and contexts and supporting them to practise this

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
