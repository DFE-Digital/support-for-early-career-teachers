title: Support for early career teachers (ECTs)
---

The DfE has selected teacher training providers who've developed materials for school-led training programmes. Schools can use these materials if they design and deliver their own programme.

## Learning materials for ECTs starting September 2025 or later

These materials are based on the initial teacher training and early career framework (ITTECF). Schools should use these materials for ECTs starting September 2025 or later.

- [UCL](https://cel-resources.ucl.ac.uk/ect)

## Learning materials for ECTs starting before September 2025
These materials are based on the early career framework (ECF). Schools can continue to use them for ECTs who've started but not yet completed training, but we encourage the use of ITTECF-based material where possible. Speak to your appropriate body if you do this.
