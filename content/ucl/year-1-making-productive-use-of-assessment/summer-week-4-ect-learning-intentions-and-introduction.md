## Learning Intentions for this session

You will learn that:
- To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.
- High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve.
- Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.                                                                                  

You will learn how to:

Provide high-quality feedback, by:

- Focusing on specific actions for pupils and providing time for pupils to respond to feedback.                                                                     - Appreciating that pupils’ responses to feedback can vary depending on a range of social factors (e.g. the message the feedback contains or the age of the child).
- Scaffolding self-assessment by sharing model work with pupils, highlighting key details.                                                                          
- Thinking carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer- or self-assessment.                                                     

## Introduction

In this module so far, you have focused on how you gather information about your pupils’ learning. In this self-study session, you will focus on what you do with this information, extending your knowledge about giving high-quality feedback.

You will explore how assessment information can be used to inform your decision making and the feedback pupils receive, as well as how they can use this feedback to move forward in their learning. With practice, pupils will increasingly be able to monitor and self-regulate their own learning through self-assessment. You will learn that the key to effective feedback is that it provides specific guidance, either verbal or written, that is clear and accurate, and that pupils are given the opportunity to act on it.
