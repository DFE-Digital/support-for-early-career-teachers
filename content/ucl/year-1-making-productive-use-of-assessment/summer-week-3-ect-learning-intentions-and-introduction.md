## Session Elements

- independent planning
- reflection

## Learning Intentions for this session

- Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.
- Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.

You will learn how to:

Check prior knowledge and understanding during lessons, by:

- Using assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing misconceptions.                                                                                           - Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions).
- Prompting pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding.
- Monitoring pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions.                                                                                              

## Introduction

In the ECT training session in week 2 and the follow-up meeting with your mentor, you looked at the fundamental principles of effective assessment. In this self-study session, you will extend your knowledge of applying good assessment practice in the classroom. You will use your learning to develop an assessment plan for a few of your pupils. You will follow this up with your mentor in your next ECT mentor meeting.
