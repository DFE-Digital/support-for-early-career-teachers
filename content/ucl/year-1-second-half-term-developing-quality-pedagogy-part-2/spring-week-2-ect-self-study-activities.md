### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Action planning

Think about a lesson that you are going to be teaching soon and have in mind 3 different pupils. These should be pupils who learn at different rates and normally require different levels and types of support to succeed. For each pupil consider:

- The levels of support they need
- Barriers to learning
- Your prior contact with family
- Their likely prior knowledge of the topic

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### 1. Scripting

You are going to script certain parts of the lesson that you had in mind from the Plan section above. The scripts will help you understand and build upon the pupils’ prior knowledge.

You are going to use some of the strategies of Dylan Wiliam, as described in the Research and Practice Summary. You will remember, as you script, your 3 pupils A, B and C, and that:

- 5.1 pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed
- 5.2 seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching
- 5.7 pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential

#### Lesson part: introducing learning intentions

##### Ideas for your script

- Who can tell me what our learning intentions mean?

#### Lesson part: Asking and responding to questions

##### Ideas for your script

- Would someone like to agree with C’s answer there, and give a reason?

#### Lesson part: Giving instructions

##### Ideas for your script

- Now you have heard the instruction from me, tell your partner in your own words what it is I want you to do

#### Lesson part: Setting up peer- and self-assessment

##### Ideas for your script

- What were the 3 best parts of the work?
- What one thing would make it better?

You are going to share your scripts with your mentor in your next meeting.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

To prepare for your next mentor meeting, write in your Learning Log any questions you want to ask your mentor that relate to this session’s learning intentions.
