## Learning Intentions for this session

| You will learn that:                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 5.3 Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.                                                 |
| 5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils. |

| You will learn how to:                                                                                                                    |

| 5h. Make use of well-designed resources (e.g., textbooks).                                                                            |
| 5i. Plan to connect new content with pupils' existing knowledge or provide additional pre-teaching if pupils lack critical knowledge. |
| 5j. Build in additional practice or remove unnecessary expositions.                                                                   |

## Introduction

In the self-directed study from Week 10 and follow-up meeting with your mentor, you looked at adaptive teaching and the importance of identifying the critical knowledge pupils need in order to access the curriculum. You reflected on your own practice both in the classroom and by looking at examples of planning.

In this self-study session, you will extend your knowledge of meeting the individual needs of pupils and balancing your workload by focusing on high-quality exposition and efficiency. Classroom dialogue is important and striking the balance between teacher-talk, pupil-talk and independent work is crucial in ensuring pupils are well supported and challenged in their learning.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.
