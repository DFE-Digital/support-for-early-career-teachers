## Learning Intentions for this session

You will learn that:

- Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.
- Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.
- Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.

## Introduction

In the last mentor session, your mentor focused in more detail on the practical implications of supporting all learners, including those with SEND. They assisted you in refining activities and approaches to be tried in the classroom.

In your self-directed study session, you will consider how establishing pupils’ prior knowledge is an essential part of teaching, that different pupils have differing levels of prior knowledge and that this affects the rate at which they learn. You might further apply your knowledge of how flexible grouping can impact upon pupil achievement. You consider again the adapted support that pupils with barriers to learning, including SEND, may need to progress in their learning.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.
