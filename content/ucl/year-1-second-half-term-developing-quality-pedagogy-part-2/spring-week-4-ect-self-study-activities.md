### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Analyse artefact

Examine your schemes of learning for the next few weeks. Identify an upcoming area of the curriculum where there may well be misconceptions which arise in the course of covering new learning over 3 lessons. You may wish to discuss this with a more experienced colleague or someone (e.g. Mrs Turner’s history colleague) more familiar with the topic.

As an alternative, you can do the same exercise with a textbook which will cover several of your upcoming lessons.

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### Action planning

Annotate the scheme of learning (or textbook) for the 3 lessons. Start with the foundational concepts (these may already be identified). What are the potential misconceptions arising from these concepts? How will you explain them, and what resources will you need? How will you plan for these lessons and be efficient with resources and time?

Make notes of your ideas and bring them to your next mentor meeting.

Bring these notes to your next mentor meeting.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Look ahead to your next mentor meeting, where you will learn how to:

- 5h. Make use of well-designed resources (e.g. textbooks).
- 5i. Plan to connect new content with pupils’ existing knowledge or provide additional pre-teaching if pupils lack critical knowledge.
- 5j. Build in additional practice or remove unnecessary expositions.
