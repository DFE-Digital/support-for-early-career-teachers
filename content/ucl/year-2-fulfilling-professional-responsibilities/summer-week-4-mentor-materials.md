ECT Mentor session

Module 9: Fulfilling professional responsibilities (II)

Week 4: Programme review and planning for year 3

Session Elements

Your ECT will:

- Review their participation in and learning from this programme
- Plan ahead for year 3 of their teaching career

Introduction

In this final session of Module 9, you will work with your mentee to review their progress this year and to plan actions for the coming year that will continue to develop them as a professional.

There is no research and practice summary for this session. You may wish to refer back to research and practice summaries from previous sessions as appropriate during your planning discussions.

Mentor Meeting Activities: 45 mins

1. Action planning

Over the three weeks of this module to date, you have been discussing with your mentee aspects of the Module 9 content for this programme. In this final session, you should now work with your mentee to draft an action plan which will support them to put into practice strategies through which they can continue to develop as a professional as they move ahead in their career.

To support this action-planning process, you could:

- encourage your mentee to use a planning format that works for them – this could be a standard planning document that you use in your school or a different approach that your mentee is familiar with
- check that targets are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound) and that clear action steps are identified to work towards each target
- refer your mentee back to the notes made in each of the sessions in this module to remind them of what was previously discussed
- use your knowledge and experience to help ensure that the action plan is sufficiently challenging whilst remaining manageable within your mentee’s overall context
- recommend that your mentee puts into their diary now a future date on which they will review their progress towards the targets set

Next Steps: 5 mins

This is the final session of the Early Career Teacher programme. If you and your mentee are both planning to stay in your school for the coming year, you may wish to plan a time in the autumn term to meet and review the action plan drafted today. Otherwise, there are no further steps to take, and your mentee has completed this programme.
