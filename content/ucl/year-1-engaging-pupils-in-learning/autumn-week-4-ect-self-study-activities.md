### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins

#### 1. Practical exercise

Think back to the cell biology scenario you considered in your first self-directed learning session of this module, where Bob had to learn about cell structures. Use that scenario as a model (see the Research and Practice Summary). For the subject, phase or setting you teach in, you will develop a similar exercise that you could use with one pupil or group of pupils to test the practices of retrieval and spaced practice.

#### 2. Independent planning

Consider your lesson plans for the forthcoming week and identify one context where you can try to use these learning strategies to aid consolidation of new information, as illustrated by the scenario with Bob.

- identify the lesson or part of a lesson that you will focus on
- write a simple plan for how you will make use of your learning about retrieval practice and spaced practice in this lesson or part of a lesson – and think about whether starting with a worked example might be helpful
- annotate your plan to show why you have designed it in this way and discuss your thoughts with your mentor when you show them your plan

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your planning from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor, including raising any questions that have come to mind while completing this task.
