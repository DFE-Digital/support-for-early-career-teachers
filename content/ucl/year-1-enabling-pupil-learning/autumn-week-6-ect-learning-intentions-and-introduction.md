## Learning Intentions for this session

You will learn that:

You will learn how to:

Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:

- Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.
- Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low- level disruption.
- Responding quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.

Build trusting relationships, by:

- Responding consistently to pupil behaviour.

## Introduction

This week is a chance to revisit some of the concepts you studied earlier in this module, now that you have had more time with your pupils. This time in the school year is often tricky in terms of behaviour, so this week provides an opportunity to return to how you maintain your high standards of behaviour and respond appropriately to disruption.
