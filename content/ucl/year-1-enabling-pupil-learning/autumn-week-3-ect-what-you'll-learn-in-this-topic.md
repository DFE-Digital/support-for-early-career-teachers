You will learn how to:

Demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations, by:
                                                                                                                                       
- Creating a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed (e.g. by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils).
- Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations (e.g. for contributions, volume level and concentration).
- Applying rules, sanctions and rewards in line with school policy, escalating behaviour incidents as appropriate.                                                                                  
- Acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made.

Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:                                                                                                                                  

- Establishing a supportive and inclusive environment with a predictable system of reward and sanction in the classroom.
- Working alongside colleagues as part of a wider system of behaviour management (e.g. recognising responsibilities and understanding the right to assistance and training from senior colleagues). 
- Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions.
- Checking pupilsâ€™ understanding of instructions before a task begins.
- Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.
- Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low-level disruption.
- Responding quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.
