This module is aligned to:

- teachers’ standard 1, setting high expectations which inspire, motivate and challenge pupils

And

- teachers’ standard 7, managing behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning
  environment

These can be considered as foundational to your teaching because they address how you set up your classroom as a learning environment.

As you work through the weeks of this module you will reflect on the different ways that you can influence your environment, and learn practical strategies that keep pupils safe, motivated and focused on learning.
