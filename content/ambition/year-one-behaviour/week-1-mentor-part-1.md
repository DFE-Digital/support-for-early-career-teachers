## Contracting meeting

Meet with your teacher and use the following prompts as the basis for a coaching contracting discussion. Contracting is most effective when both parties (yourself and the ECT) answer questions for each other.

1. Professional prompts
  * What is important to you in your work?
  * What do you want to get out of this process?
  * What do you need from me to make this work well?

2. Procedural prompts
  * What is the best way for us to communicate and when?
  * When are the best times to meet for our mentor sessions?
  * What classes/subjects are best to observe?

3. Psychological prompts
  * What does an effective professional relationship look like for you? Can you give me an example?
  * What experience have you had of observation? How can we make observation an effective experience?
  * What experiences do you have of coaching? What might we need to do to embrace this coaching approach?
