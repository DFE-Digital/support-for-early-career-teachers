## Presenter intro: Peps McCrea

We want to give all pupils the best chance of success in their learning. Teachers need to give clear instructions so that pupils know what to do and how to do it. Good instructions can also help to create an effective environment and improve pupil behaviour. When teachers give instructions, they have the chance to explicitly state their expectations so that everybody can meet them. We can achieve a lot with a few well-planned words.

## Presenter main

The moments when a teacher sets out the activity instructions matter a lot. Good instructions can increase desirable behaviour and help pupils to get on with the tasks and activities set. So teachers need to plan their instructions carefully.

Firstly, you need to think about what you will say. Provide manageable, individual steps and specifically point out what pupils should do. And try to keep instructions short. Cut out redundant words. In an EYFS setting, for example, you might say, “first, let’s stand up with two feet on your bug spot”, instead of a more long-winded version like, “first I want everyone to stand up and stand right on your bug spot so that we can get ready to move back to our seats.” We can only think about a few things at once, so it’s important to limit the number of steps or words in our instructions. Focus on what matters the most.

Ordering steps sequentially also helps pupils to follow them. For example, “first you need to highlight a key phrase, then you need to label what it means.”  Another approach is to tell pupils what to do with their mouth, their body and their brain. For example, you might ask pupils to “work in silence on your own and order the fractions from smallest to largest.” This format won’t be appropriate in all instances, but where it is, it can help both pupils and teachers remember what to do.

Visual supports can also help pupils to understand instructions. For example, you might want to add a recognizable hand gesture for activities that pupils are familiar with. And you might also wish to include a list of written instructions to accompany your verbal instructions so that pupils can refer back to them.

As well as thinking about what to say, you need to think about how you will say it. Think about how you’re standing and your tone of voice. You need to make it clear that what you’re saying is important and that pupils should pay attention to it. Teachers need to stand at a spot where they can see all pupils and they need to stand still. This allows both teacher and pupil to focus on the content of the instruction. As for voice, it’s good to speak in a formal tone when delivering instructions.

It’s easy to overlook the importance of instructions. Teachers spend lots of time thinking about what pupils will learn and designing a great task, but can sometimes forget to plan how they will explain it to pupils. There’s a risk that this planning time will go to waste because pupils won’t know how to get on with the task. It’s worth scripting out what you will say and practicing it. The more you do this, the quicker you will get at it, and the more effective your instructions will be.

When pupils have a good understanding of how to do something, they’re much more likely to give it a go.

## Presenter exemplification framing

In a moment, you’re going to watch a model of how to deliver effective task instructions. As you watch, pay particular attention to the following:

* Manageable, specific and sequential instructions
* Uses voice and body to ensure pupils pay attention

## Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach

In this example, I want you to imagine that I’m teaching a year three class who are working hard on an independent writing task. I’m going to gain their attention and give instructions for what to do next.

> “Pens down, hands on desks and eyes on me in three, two, and one. Thank you.
> 
> Okay, I need you to listen really carefully for what to do next.
> 
> One, put your book in your folder. Two, put your folder in the middle of your table. Make sure they are facing up. Three, put your hands on your desks and look at me so that I know you are ready.
> 
> I need you to do all of this without speaking.
> 
> Okay. Mohammed, where do you need to put your book?
> 
> And Stewart, where are you going to put your folder?
> 
> And Ashley, how are you showing me you are ready?
> 
> Thank you. Okay, 30 seconds, off you go.”

In this model, I made sure that my instructions were manageable by breaking down the task into three small steps. I was really specific, telling them precisely where to place their books and their folders. And I presented the steps in a sequential order. First, they put their books in their folder. Then they put the folder in the middle of their tables. I also included non-verbal signals. For example, placing the books in the folder, to help draw attention to this step.

I used consistent language. “Pens down, hands on desks” is a phrase that I repeat throughout my lessons, which helps it to stick.

As I spoke to the pupils, I used a formal tone of voice. I use this tone of voice for instructions because I want to signal that what I’m saying is important. It encourages the pupils to pay attention.

Overall, the instruction had clarity, both in terms of content and delivery. All of this together helps my pupils to know precisely what I’m asking them to do, making it more likely that they will be successful.
Presenter key ideas

Effective task instructions can have a positive impact on behaviour and learning when teachers make it crystal clear to pupils what they need to do. Before we finish, read over the key ideas that we have covered in this video. Which of these do you feel that you can improve on in your practice?

* Using consistent language and non-verbal signs
* Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions
* Making the steps in a process memorable, and ensuring pupils can recall them
* Delivered using an appropriate tone of voice

## Presenter summary

Giving effective instructions is something that teachers can learn to do well. And when they do, pupils are more likely to know what is being asked of them and get off to a great start.
