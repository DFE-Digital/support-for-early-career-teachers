## Context-specific meeting

In addition to contracting, as required, you may wish to meet with your teacher to work through any context-specific policies, systems and/or procedures that they will need to know about to be effective in their role. It is also important for teachers to be made aware of school-specific policies so you may wish to point your NQT to these and provide some time to discuss them.

Typical school policies include, but are not limited to:

* Their responsibilities planning.
* The schoolâ€™s behaviour policy.
* The safeguarding procedures.
* How your school assesses pupils.
* Your marking requirements.
