## Observation discussion - effective questioning to extend and challenge pupils

### Teaching techniques to focus feedback on

### Interaction:

Observation

### Outcome:

To have planned and practised effective questioning to extend and challenge pupils.

### Stimulus

- Check whole class understanding
- Provide appropriate wait time after asking a question to allow pupils to generate a response
- Not complete pupils' answers
- Ask follow-up questions to extend and challenge pupils
- Provide scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of dialogue
