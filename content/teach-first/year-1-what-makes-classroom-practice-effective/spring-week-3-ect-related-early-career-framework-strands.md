### Classroom practice

4.4 Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases.

4.8 Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success.

_4a. Using modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need more structure early in a domain._

_4c. Removing scaffolding only when pupils are achieving a high degree of success in applying previously taught material._

_4d. Providing sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate and practise applying new knowledge and skills._

_4e. Breaking tasks down into constituent components when first setting up independent practice (e.g. using tasks that scaffold pupils through meta-cognitive and procedural processes)._

### Subject and curriculum

3.10 Every teacher can improve pupilsâ€™ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines.

_3n. Supporting younger pupils to become fluent readers and to write fluently and legibly._

_3r. Modelling and requiring high-quality oral language, recognising that spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing (e.g. requiring pupils to respond to questions in full sentences, making use of relevant technical vocabulary)._
