## Observation discussion - using ‘think aloud’ to model cognitive and metacognitive processes

### Teaching techniques to focus feedback on

### Interaction:

Observation

### Outcome:

To have planned and practised using ‘Think Aloud’ to model cognitive and metacognitive processes

### Stimulus

Observe your teacher using ‘Think Aloud’, considering whether they:

- Start the narration at the point of pupil understanding
- Focus the narration around key teaching points
- Model using key terminology

### Praise, probe and set precise actions

The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacher’s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.

### Plan and practice ideas

Work with your teacher to either improve the narration they used within the lesson or narrate ‘Think Aloud’ for an upcoming lesson. When doing so consider:

- Starting narration at the point of pupil understanding
- Focusing the narration around key teaching points
- Modelling using key terminology

### Key questions and talking points

1. What is cognition and metacognition?
2. Why is ‘Think Aloud’ so important? Why is if often missed out in planning and teaching?
3. What are the key things to remember when planning for and using ‘Think Aloud’?
4. How can you make the steps in a process memorable for pupils? E.g. Name them, use mnemonics, link to memorable stories
