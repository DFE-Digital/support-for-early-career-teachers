As a teacher, you draw your conclusions about pupil learning from their pattern of performance from a number of assessments over time. A summative assessment is a snapshot in time in pupil learning, and it is important to recognise what they can and canâ€™t tell you about pupil understanding.

This session will focus on:

- The importance and challenges of summative data
- Identifying patterns of performance
