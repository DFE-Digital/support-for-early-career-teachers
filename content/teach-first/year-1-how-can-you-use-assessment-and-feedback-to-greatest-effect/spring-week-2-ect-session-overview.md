When lesson planning, it is important to consider how and where you will include assessment opportunities. As highlighted in session 1, your assessment needs to be driven by its purpose and you should be clear about what information you are trying to capture.

This session will focus on:

- How to plan for effective assessment
- Structuring questions to anticipate and identify misconceptions
