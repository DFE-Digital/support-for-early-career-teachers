## Discussion - having a clear purpose for any planned assessment opportunities

### Teaching techniques to focus feedback on

### Interaction:

Discussion

### Outcome:

To have a clear purpose for any planned assessment opportunities.

### Stimulus

In their online study materials, your teacher heard from Mike Walker, Chair of the Advisory Board at Evidence Based Education, explain that it is important to consider the purpose of the assessments teachers are planning and whether they have selected an assessment that is going to give them the data they need.

During this section, your teacher was then asked to consider the assessment opportunities they have planned into their lessons already and reflect on their purpose. Discuss this activity with the teacher and decide whether the assessment opportunities are purposeful and will help them to decide what the next steps are for their pupils, and for them as the teacher.

### Praise, probe and set precise actions

The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacherâ€™s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.
