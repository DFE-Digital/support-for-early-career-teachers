### Assessment

6.1 Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupilsâ€™ understanding and needs.

6.2 Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.

6.3 Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.

6.4 To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.

_6a. Planning formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives and thinking ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using hinge questions to pinpoint knowledge gaps)._

_6e. Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions)._

_6g. Monitoring pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions._

_6q. Prioritising the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather than careless mistakes when marking._
