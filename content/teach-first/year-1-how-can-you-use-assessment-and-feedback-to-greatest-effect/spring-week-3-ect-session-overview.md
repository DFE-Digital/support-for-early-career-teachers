This session will take approximately 45 minutes to complete.

It is important to check for understanding throughout your lesson and monitor for the occurrence of misconceptions. If you do spot a mistake, how best should this be corrected?

This session will focus on:

- Monitoring pupilsâ€™ independent practice for the development of misconceptions
- Deciding when is best to give feedback, and what form that will take
