### How pupils learn

_2g. Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so that misconceptions can be addressed._

### Subject and curriculum

_3e. Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts._

### Classroom practice

4.4 Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases.

### Assessment

6.2 Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.

6.3 Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.

_6a. Planning formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives and thinking ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using hinge questions to pinpoint knowledge gaps)._

_6d. Using assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing misconceptions._

_6e. Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions)._

_6f. Prompting pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding._ _6g. Monitoring pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions._
