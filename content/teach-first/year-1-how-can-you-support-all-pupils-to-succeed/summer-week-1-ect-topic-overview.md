For pupils to be successful in the classroom, they need to be able to access the curriculum being taught. However, for many pupils, there are barriers that prevent them from doing so. One potential barrier to learning is poor literacy skills (EEF, 2018).

You can support pupils' literacy development whichever phase or subject you are teaching. To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- The importance of high-quality oral language

- Teaching vocabulary

  - Developing language in Early Years
  - Developing language in Primary and Secondary settings
