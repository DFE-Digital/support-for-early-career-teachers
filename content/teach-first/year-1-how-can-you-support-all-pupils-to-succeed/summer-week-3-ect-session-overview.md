Every pupil is different. They each come to school with a variety of different life experiences, prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning. Therefore, the pupils you teach are likely to learn at different rates and require different levels and types of support. Adaptive teaching can help you support all pupils to succeed.

In this session, you will explore:

- High-quality teaching
- Adaptive teaching
- Developing knowledge through pre-teaching
