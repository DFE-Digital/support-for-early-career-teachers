In your teacher’s online study materials, they were asked to Consider an upcoming explanation, or an explanation that they have recently done with a class. They were asked to reflect on they could pair verbal and graphical representations to support understanding. Ask them to share their reflections with you and discuss them.

Then work with your teacher to plan this strategy either into the lesson that you observed or an upcoming lesson. When doing so consider the following:

- How could you use a diagram to support the pupils understanding?
- Which of the examples could you selected and why?
- How will it support your explanation and reduce pupils working memory overload load?

### Key questions and talking points

1. When have you overloaded your pupils? What was the cause of this and the implication on the learning for the affected pupils?
2. Why is it important to remove any unnecessary expositions when teaching new material?
