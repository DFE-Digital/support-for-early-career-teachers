## How Pupils Learn

2.1 Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding.

2.2 Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.

2.3 An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory.

2.4 Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded.

2.5 Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.

_2a. Taking into account pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce._

_2c. Reducing distractions that take attention away from what is being taught (e.g. keeping the complexity of a task to a minimum, so that attention is focused on the content)._

_2e. Linking what pupils already know to what is being taught (e.g. explaining how new content builds on what is already known)._

## Subject and Curriculum

_3a. Identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these critical components._

_3b. Ensuring pupils’ thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject._

## Classroom practice

_4f. Starting expositions at the point of current pupil understanding._
