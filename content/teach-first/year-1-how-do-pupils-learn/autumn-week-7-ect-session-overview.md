## Introduction to metacognition and self-regulation

Research has found that metacognition and self-regulation are important for pupil learning. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) have found that when harnessed effectively, these strategies can improve attainment of disadvantaged learners (EEF, 2018). Therefore, it is important to explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies linked to their subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate their work. This short session will aim to give you an introduction to metacognition and self-regulation, which will be built upon during your next mentor interaction.
