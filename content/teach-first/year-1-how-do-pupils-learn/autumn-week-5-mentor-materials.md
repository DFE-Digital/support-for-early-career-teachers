## Discussion - creating a low stakes quiz to be used for retrieval practise

### Teaching techniques to focus feedback on

### Interaction:

Discussion

### Outcome:

To have practised creating a low stakes quiz to be used for retrieval practise.

###  Stimulus
As part of their training session your teacher was asked to create a retrieval quiz. Review this with your teacher.

###  Praise, probe and set precise actions
The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacher’s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.

### Plan and practice ideas

Work with your teacher to support them in either improving their current low stakes quiz or developing a new one for an upcoming lesson.

### Key questions and talking points

1. What existing knowledge do pupils have in relation to a topic that they are about to learn about?
2. How will prior knowledge support with the development of their mental model?
3. Are there any holes or misconceptions that need to be addressed? Are all pupils starting from the same point? If not, how might this be addressed?
4. How can you develop both storage and retrieval strength?
