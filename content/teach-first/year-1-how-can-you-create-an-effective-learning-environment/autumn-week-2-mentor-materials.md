## Observation discussion - entry and settling routines

### Teaching techniques to focus feedback on

### Interaction:

Observation

### Outcome:

To have planned and practised a routine.

### Stimulus

During the online study materials, your teacher was informed that their classroom routines will be observed. They were asked to plan how to teach or improve a routine by scripting exactly what they will say. Based on their developmental needs, it was suggested that they choose one of the routines below (listed in order of highest leverage) to implement or improve:

- Greet at the door and settling routine
- Getting pupils’ attention
- Carpet to task or tables
- Exit routine
  The success criteria for these is in the online study materials. Observe your teacher and their class performing one or more of the above routines with a focus on the success criteria in the online study materials.

### Praise, probe and set precise actions

The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacher’s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.

### Plan and practice ideas

Work with your teacher to plan and practise the chosen routine by ensuring they:

1. Are clear on what they want pupils to do. Ensure their instructions are:
  - Specific and observable
  - Sequential
  - Manageable
2. Plan to teach and model their routine in small steps
3. Plan to practise their routine

### Key questions and talking points

1. Why are routines so critical to classrooms? How do they support teachers create a predictable and secure environment?
2. What makes routines effective? This is an opportunity to recap how to ensure that routines are effective and share any mentor best practice with the early career teacher (ECT).
3. Which routines do you feel are the highest leverage to your practice? And why?
