## Observation discussion - positive and least invasive behaviour management strategies

### Teaching techniques to focus feedback on

### Interaction:

Observation

### Outcome:

To have planned and practised positive and least invasive behaviour management strategies.

### Stimulus:

Observe your teacher using positive and least invasive behaviour management strategies such as:

- Non-verbal intervention
- Positive group correction.
- Anonymous individual correction
- Private individual correction
- Private individual praise
- Lighting quick public correction

### Praise, probe and set precise actions

The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacher’s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.

### Plan and practice ideas

Work with your teacher to plan and practise using positive, least invasive behaviour management strategies. You could discuss and focus the practise on specific misbehaviour that you saw during the lesson or situations that the teacher has previously experienced and is finding difficult to deal with.

### Key questions and talking points

1. Why is it important to manage behaviour in a positive and least invasive way?
2. What should you do if you are feeling very agitated by a pupil in your class? How can this negatively impact upon your behaviour management strategies? What can you do to help you control your emotions in these situations?

Discuss possible behaviour management strategies alongside the school’s behaviour policy i.e. how to respond to behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.

Discuss when teachers should contact parents and what the process is for doing so.

Discuss with teachers that they have the right to support and if they are finding behaviour challenging, they should seek support from colleagues.
