## Observation discussion - increase pupil participation

### Teaching techniques to focus feedback on

### Interaction:

Observation

### Outcome:

To have planned and practised a strategy to increase pupil participation.

### Stimulus

Observe your teacher with a focus on pupil participation and consider the following:

- Are many pupils in the lesson participating in discussing or being expected to think and engage?
- What do they do to ensure high participation e.g. holding high expectations for contributions, using countdowns or timers, making the beginning and end of tasks clear, asking questions to the whole class?
- If necessary, how do they/ could they address low participation?

### Praise, probe and set precise actions

The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacher’s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.

### Plan and practice ideas

Work with your teacher to plan and practise how to ensure a high level of pupil participation.

### Key questions and talking points

1. Why is a high participation and think ration important?
2. How can you increase the participation of
   pupils in your class?
3. What is our school’s approach to high expectations for all pupils?
4. How can you create an environment where it’s okay to make mistakes? How does this reflect your high expectations and how can this impact upon pupil engagement?
5. How could you engage parents and carers in the education of their children? E.g. by proactively highlighting successes.
