As we saw in the last session, when a pupil is off-task or causing low-level disruption, you should try and correct this using one of the least invasive techniques. However, if a pupil keeps exhibiting disruptive behaviours, or if their behaviour is more challenging or severe, it is likely you will need to address this by issuing a consequence or sanction.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- Why are consequences or sanctions important?

- How to issue consequences or sanctions effectively

  - Consistent
  - Depersonalised
  - Deferred

- Identifying the appropriate consequences or sanctions
