Pupils tend to enjoy learning and do better when they are more intrinsically rather than extrinsically motivated to achieve. Therefore, you should help pupils journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically.

To support you to do this, this session will explore:

- What determines intrinsic motivation?

- How can you boost motivation?

  - Providing opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success
  - Creating a positive learning environment where it's safe to make mistakes
  - Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils' long-term goals
