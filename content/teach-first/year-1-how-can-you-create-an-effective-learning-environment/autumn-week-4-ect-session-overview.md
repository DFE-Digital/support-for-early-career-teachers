You can affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of your pupils. When behaviour incidents occur, no matter how small or large, it’s important that you respond consistently in the least intrusive ways which align with your school’s behaviour policy or approach.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- What is low-level disruption?
- Using early and least intrusive interventions as an initial response
