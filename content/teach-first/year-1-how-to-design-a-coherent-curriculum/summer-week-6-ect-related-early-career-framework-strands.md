### Subject and curriculum

3.6 In order for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about.

3.8 Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context.

_3f. Discussing curriculum design with experienced colleagues and balancing exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge._

_3i. Providing tasks that support pupils to learn key ideas securely (e.g. quizzing pupils so they develop fluency with times tables)._

_3j. Using retrieval and spaced practice to build automatic recall of key knowledge._

_3k. Ensuring pupils have relevant domain-specific knowledge, especially when being asked to think critically within a subject._
