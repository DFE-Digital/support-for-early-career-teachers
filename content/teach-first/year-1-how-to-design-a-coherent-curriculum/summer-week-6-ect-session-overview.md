In this session, we are going to build on your prior knowledge from module 2 to think about how you can support pupils to build increasingly complex mental models over time. This is a challenging part of effective teaching and discussing curriculum design with experienced colleagues (including how to balance exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge over time) will support your development in these skills.

This session will focus on:

- Revisiting how pupils learn
- The difficulty of transferring knowledge
- Thinking critically within a subject area
