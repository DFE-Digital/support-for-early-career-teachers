### Subject and curriculum

3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.

_3b. Ensuring pupils’ thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject._

_3g. Revisiting the big ideas of the subject over time and teaching key concepts through a range of examples._

_3h. Drawing explicit links between new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject._
