## Discussion - identifying the concepts, knowledge and skills in a scheme of work

### Practice focus

### Interaction:

Discussion

### Outcome:

To have identified the concepts, knowledge and skills in a scheme of work

### Stimulus

During the online study materials, your teacher was asked to identify the concepts knowledge and skills for their scheme of work and to record this to share with you. The following guidance questions were provided:

- What essential concepts, knowledge and skills do you want pupils to learn in this scheme of work?
- What Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary will need to be revisited or taught to pupils?

You could also think about:

- Is there additional knowledge, skills or values that would support or enrich the learning in this scheme?
- An estimate of how much time will be needed to teach and learn this scheme _(there may be existing time restrictions, in which case you will need to prioritise the most important concepts, knowledge and skills)_

Record your responses in a format that suits you (e.g. note-form, table, diagram etc.)

Review and discuss the responses.

### Praise, probe and set precise actions

The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacherâ€™s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.

### Plan and practice ideas

Work with your teacher to improve the identification of concepts, knowledge and skills for their scheme of work.

### Key questions and talking points

1. What big ideas of the subject or key concepts is this scheme building upon?
2. What follows this scheme and what new content do pupils need for successful learning in the future?
3. What concepts, knowledge and skills have you identified and why?
4. What concepts, knowledge and skills did you decide not to include and why?
5. What Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary have you identified and why?
6. Have you included any additional knowledge, skills or values that would support and/or enrich the learning in this scheme? If so, why?
7. How much time do you estimate will be needed to teach this scheme of work?
